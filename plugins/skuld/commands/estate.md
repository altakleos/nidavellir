# Estate Planning Workflow

This command launches the full 5-phase estate planning workflow.

## What Happens When You Run /estate

1. **Welcome & Discovery** - I'll display educational context, check for existing profiles, and conduct an interview to understand your situation (family, assets, goals, state of residence).

2. **Document Selection** - Based on your situation, I'll recommend appropriate documents (trust, will, POA, healthcare directive) and explain what each does.

3. **Document Drafting** - I'll generate each document with your specific information, presenting drafts for your approval before saving.

4. **Execution Guidance** - I'll provide state-specific instructions for signing, witnessing, and notarizing your documents.

5. **Funding & Next Steps** - I'll create checklists for trust funding and ongoing maintenance.

## Before You Begin

Have the following information ready:
- Full legal names (you and spouse if married)
- State of residence
- Children's names and birth dates (if any)
- General idea of assets (real estate states, retirement accounts, business interests)
- Who you'd want as:
  - Successor trustee (manages trust if you can't)
  - Executor (handles estate through probate)
  - Guardian (raises minor children if both parents pass)
  - Healthcare agent (makes medical decisions if you can't)
  - Financial agent (manages finances if incapacitated)

## Important Notice

All documents generated are **DRAFTS intended for attorney review**. I provide educational information to help you understand your options and prepare for working with an attorney.

## Resume Existing Session

If you have an existing profile from a previous session, I'll detect it and ask whether you want to continue or start fresh.

## Commands Within the Workflow

During the workflow, you can:
- Navigate by saying "go back to discovery" or "skip to drafting"
- Ask questions about any terms or concepts
- Request explanations of your options
- Review and modify your profile information
