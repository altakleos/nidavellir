## Fiduciary Roles

### Successor Trustee

The person who manages your trust if you can't—either due to incapacity or death.

**What they do:**
- Pay bills and manage investments from trust assets
- Distribute assets to beneficiaries per trust terms
- Handle tax filings and record-keeping
- Work with financial institutions to manage accounts

**Key point:** You remain trustee while alive and capable. The successor only takes over when you can't.

**How to choose:**
- Must be trustworthy (full access to all assets)
- Should be organized (administration requires attention to detail)
- Needs availability (time commitment required)
- Options: spouse, adult child, sibling, trusted friend, professional trustee (bank/trust company)

**Common questions:**
- *Can I name more than one?* Yes, you can name co-trustees or a succession of backups.
- *What if they can't serve?* Name alternates. Having 2-3 successors is recommended.
- *Can I name a bank?* Yes, professional trustees handle complex situations but charge fees.

### Guardian

Person who raises your minor children if both parents pass.

**What they do:**
- Legal custody and daily care of children
- Educational and medical decisions
- Provide a home and family environment
- NOT financial management (that's the trustee's role)

**Key point:** Guardian and trustee can be different people. Separating roles provides checks and balances—the guardian raises the children while the trustee manages their inheritance.

**How to choose:**
- Consider parenting style alignment
- Geographic location matters (will children need to move?)
- Age and health of potential guardian
- Their own family situation
- Willingness to serve (always confirm before naming)

**Important:** If the other biological/adoptive parent is living, they typically have custody rights regardless of your will's guardian nomination.

---

### Executor

Person who handles your probate estate after death.

**What they do:**
- Files your final tax returns
- Pays debts and expenses
- Distributes assets per your will
- Works with probate court
- Handles administrative tasks (closing accounts, notifying institutions)

**Key point:** If you have a revocable living trust, the executor role is smaller—the "pour-over will" just moves any forgotten assets into the trust. Most administration happens through the trustee.

**How to choose:**
- Same considerations as trustee
- Often the same person serves both roles
- Should be comfortable with paperwork and deadlines

---

### Healthcare Agent (Healthcare Proxy)

Person who makes medical decisions for you if you cannot speak for yourself.

**What they do:**
- Communicate with doctors about treatment options
- Make decisions about surgery, medications, life support
- Access your medical records
- Ensure your wishes are followed

**Key point:** This is only activated if you're incapacitated (unconscious, in a coma, or mentally unable to decide). While you're capable, you make your own decisions.

**How to choose:**
- Someone who knows your values and wishes
- Willing to advocate for you even under pressure
- Available to respond quickly in emergencies
- Emotionally capable of making difficult decisions

**Common questions:**
- *Can I limit their authority?* Yes, you can specify what they can and cannot decide.
- *What if they're unavailable?* Name alternates. Healthcare emergencies don't wait.

---

### Financial Agent (Power of Attorney)

Person who manages your finances if you're incapacitated.

**What they do:**
- Access bank accounts to pay bills
- Manage investments
- Handle tax matters
- Sign documents on your behalf
- Deal with insurance, real estate, etc.

**Key point:** A "durable" power of attorney remains effective even if you become incapacitated. A "springing" POA only activates upon incapacity.

**How to choose:**
- Must be completely trustworthy (broad financial access)
- Financially responsible
- Organized and detail-oriented
- Often the same person as successor trustee

**Common questions:**
- *When does this take effect?* Depends on the type—immediate or upon incapacity.
- *Can they access retirement accounts?* Generally yes, for management purposes.

## Document Types

### Revocable Living Trust

A legal arrangement where you transfer ownership of assets to a trust that you control during your lifetime.

**Benefits:**
- Avoids probate (faster, private asset transfer)
- Seamless incapacity management
- Flexible—can be changed anytime while you're alive
- You remain in control as trustee

**Key point:** "Revocable" means you can change or cancel it. "Living" means created during your lifetime (vs. testamentary trusts created by will).

---

### Pour-Over Will

A will that "catches" any assets not in your trust and directs them into the trust at death.

**Purpose:**
- Backup for assets you forgot to transfer
- Handles assets acquired shortly before death
- Ensures everything ends up in the trust

**Key point:** Assets that go through the pour-over will still go through probate—but then flow into the trust for distribution.

---

### Power of Attorney (POA)

A document authorizing someone to act on your behalf for financial matters.

**Types:**
- **Durable POA** - Remains effective if you become incapacitated
- **Springing POA** - Only activates upon incapacity
- **Limited POA** - Covers specific transactions only

---

### Healthcare Directive (Advance Directive)

Documents expressing your healthcare wishes and appointing a healthcare agent.

**Components:**
- **Living Will** - Your preferences for end-of-life care
- **Healthcare Proxy** - Names your healthcare agent
- **HIPAA Authorization** - Allows access to medical records

---

### QDOT (Qualified Domestic Trust)

A special trust required when leaving assets to a non-citizen spouse to defer estate taxes.

**Why needed:** The unlimited marital deduction (no tax on assets passing to spouse) is NOT available for non-citizen spouses without a QDOT.

**Requirements:**
- At least one U.S. citizen or U.S. bank as trustee
- Specific IRS requirements must be met
- Estate tax is deferred, not eliminated

---

### SNT (Special Needs Trust)

A trust designed to provide for a beneficiary with disabilities without disqualifying them from government benefits.

**Types:**
- **Third-Party SNT** - Funded by someone other than the beneficiary (parents, grandparents)
- **First-Party SNT** - Funded with the beneficiary's own assets

**Key point:** Properly structured, SNT assets don't count against benefit eligibility for SSI, Medicaid, etc.

## Estate Planning Concepts

### Probate

The court-supervised process of transferring assets after death.

**What happens:**
- Will is validated by court
- Executor is officially appointed
- Debts and taxes are paid
- Remaining assets distributed to beneficiaries

**Downsides:**
- Public record (anyone can see)
- Can take 6 months to 2+ years
- Court costs and attorney fees
- Less flexibility

**Avoiding probate:** Revocable living trusts, beneficiary designations, and joint ownership can bypass probate.

---

### Trust Funding

The process of transferring assets into your trust's ownership.

**What gets funded:**
- Real estate (deed transferred to trust)
- Bank accounts (retitled in trust name)
- Investment accounts (some have restrictions)
- Business interests

**What doesn't get funded:**
- Retirement accounts (IRAs, 401ks) - use beneficiary designations instead
- Life insurance - name trust as beneficiary if desired

**Key point:** An unfunded trust provides no probate avoidance. Funding is essential.

---

### Beneficiary Designation

Instructions on financial accounts (retirement, life insurance) specifying who receives the assets at death.

**Key point:** Beneficiary designations OVERRIDE your will and trust. If your will says "everything to my children" but your 401(k) names your ex-spouse as beneficiary, your ex-spouse gets the 401(k).

**Action required:** Review and update beneficiary designations to align with your estate plan.

---

### Incapacity Planning

Preparing for the possibility that you might become unable to manage your own affairs while still alive.

**Documents involved:**
- Durable Power of Attorney (financial decisions)
- Healthcare Directive (medical decisions)
- Revocable Trust (asset management via successor trustee)

**Without planning:** Family may need court-appointed guardianship/conservatorship—expensive, time-consuming, and public.
