# Estate Tax Allocation and Apportionment

## Overview

Estate tax allocation determines **who bears the burden of estate taxes** when an estate owes federal or state estate tax. Without proper planning, taxes may be paid disproportionately by certain beneficiaries, potentially disrupting the decedent's intended distribution.

## Why Tax Allocation Matters

### The Problem

Estate tax is calculated on the **entire taxable estate**, but assets pass in different ways:

| Asset Type | How It Passes | In Probate? |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Assets in trust | Per trust terms | No |
| Beneficiary designations | Direct to beneficiary | No |
| Joint accounts | To survivor | No |
| POD/TOD accounts | Direct to beneficiary | No |
| Probate assets | Through will | Yes |

**Without allocation clauses**, estate tax may come entirely from probate assets (the residue), even though non-probate assets contribute to the tax.

### Example: The Unfair Burden

```
Estate: $20 million
- $5 million in revocable trust (to children from first marriage)
- $8 million life insurance (beneficiary: second spouse)
- $7 million in probate estate (residue to charity)

Federal estate tax due: ~$2.4 million (on amount over exemption)

WITHOUT ALLOCATION CLAUSE:
- Tax paid from residue = $2.4 million
- Charity receives: $7M - $2.4M = $4.6 million
- Second spouse receives: $8 million (tax-free)
- Children receive: $5 million (tax-free)

Result: Charity bears entire tax burden despite others receiving more.
```

## Default Rules (No Planning)

### Federal Default Rule

Under IRC §2206-2207B, without contrary direction:
- Estate representative pays from probate estate
- May have right to recover from certain beneficiaries
- Life insurance: Can recover from beneficiary (§2206)
- General power of appointment: Can recover from appointee (§2207)
- QTIP property: Can recover from trust (§2207A)

**But**: Recovery rights often waived or unclaimed in practice.

### State Default Rules

States vary significantly:

| Approach | Description | Example States |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Apportionment | Tax allocated proportionally | FL, NY, PA |
| Burden on residue | Residue pays all taxes | Common law default |
| Pro rata | Based on share received | Some states |

**Tennessee:** No state estate tax. For federal tax, look to will/trust provisions or federal default rules.

## Allocation Approaches

### 1. Pay from Residue (Absorptive Allocation)

All taxes paid from the residuary estate.

**Advantages:**
- Simple administration
- Non-probate beneficiaries receive full amount
- Predictable for named beneficiaries

**Disadvantages:**
- May dramatically reduce residuary share
- Can eliminate residuary gifts entirely
- May frustrate decedent's intent

**Appropriate When:**
- Residuary is substantial
- Specific bequests are primary concern
- Residuary beneficiaries understand they bear tax

### 2. Equitable Apportionment (Pro Rata)

Tax allocated proportionally based on benefit received.

**Advantages:**
- Fair distribution of tax burden
- Each beneficiary pays their "share"
- Follows many state default rules

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex calculations
- Requires collection from non-probate beneficiaries
- May reduce amounts to all beneficiaries

**Calculation Example:**
```
$20 million estate, $2 million tax
- Life insurance beneficiary: 40% of estate → pays $800,000
- Trust beneficiaries: 30% of estate → pays $600,000
- Residuary: 30% of estate → pays $600,000
```

### 3. Marital/Charitable Deduction Offset

Tax allocated only to non-deductible transfers.

**Rationale:**
- Marital transfers generate no tax (unlimited deduction)
- Charitable transfers generate no tax (unlimited deduction)
- Why should deductible transfers bear tax burden?

**Example:**
```
$20 million estate
- $10 million to spouse (marital deduction)
- $5 million to charity (charitable deduction)
- $5 million to children (taxable)

Tax allocated entirely to children's share.
Spouse and charity receive full amounts.
```

### 4. Hybrid Approach

Combination of methods:
- Specific bequests exempt from tax
- Residuary bears tax on probate assets
- Non-probate assets bear their own tax
- Charitable gifts protected from allocation

```

### Absorptive (Residue Pays All)
> "All estate, inheritance, and death taxes shall be paid from my residuary estate without apportionment or contribution from any beneficiary."

### Pro Rata Apportionment
> "All death taxes shall be apportioned among all persons interested in my estate in the proportion that the value of their interest bears to the total taxable estate."

### Protecting Charitable Gifts
> "Estate taxes shall not be allocated to or paid from any bequest to a qualified charitable organization."

## State Estate Tax Considerations

### States with Estate Tax (2025)

| State | Exemption | Allocation Considerations |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Connecticut | $13.99M | Mirrors federal |
| Hawaii | $5.49M | Check state default |
| Illinois | $4M | Equitable apportionment |
| Maine | $7M | Check state default |
| Maryland | ~$5M | Apportionment statute |
| Massachusetts | $2M | Check state default |
| Minnesota | ~$3M | Apportionment required |
| New York | $7.16M | Apportionment statute |
| Oregon | $1M | Pro rata default |
| Rhode Island | $1.8M | Check state default |
| Vermont | $5M | Check state default |
| Washington | $3M | Equitable apportionment |
| DC | $4.87M | Apportionment statute |

### Multi-State Estates

When decedent owns property in multiple states:
- Each state may tax property located there
- Allocation clause should address state taxes
- May need separate calculations per state

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Non-Probate Assets

**Problem:** Tax clause only addresses probate assets, ignoring that life insurance or retirement accounts increase taxable estate.

**Solution:** Coordinate beneficiary designations with tax allocation clause.

### 2. Charitable Gift Erosion

**Problem:** Charitable bequest reduced by tax allocation, potentially losing charitable deduction entirely.

**Solution:** Explicitly exclude charitable bequests from tax allocation.

### 3. Insufficient Liquidity

**Problem:** Residuary doesn't have enough liquid assets to pay allocated taxes.

**Solution:** Plan for liquidity through life insurance or asset restructuring.

### 4. Conflicting Documents

**Problem:** Will says one thing about tax allocation, trust says another.

**Solution:** Coordinate language across all estate planning documents.

### 5. Generation-Skipping Tax Oversight

**Problem:** GST tax allocated incorrectly, causing unintended tax burden on non-skip beneficiaries.

**Solution:** Address GST separately in allocation clause.

## Tennessee-Specific Considerations

### No State Estate Tax
Tennessee repealed its inheritance tax effective January 1, 2016. There is no state estate tax.

### Federal Tax Still Applies
For estates exceeding $13.99 million (2025), federal estate tax applies regardless of state of residence.

### Trust Language
Tennessee trusts should still include tax allocation clauses for:
- Federal estate tax
- State taxes if beneficiaries live in taxing states
- GST tax allocation

### Community Property Trust Impact
If using Tennessee Community Property Trust:
- All CPT assets included in estate at first death (for step-up)
- Tax allocation should address this
- May affect liquidity planning
