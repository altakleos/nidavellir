# Basis and Step-Up Rules

## Overview

Understanding basis rules is crucial for estate planning. The difference between carryover basis (gifts) and stepped-up basis (inheritance) can significantly impact income tax on asset sales.

## What is Basis?

**Basis** is the tax cost of an asset, used to calculate gain or loss on sale.

```
Sale Price - Basis = Gain (or Loss)
```

**Example:**
- Buy stock for $10,000 (basis)
- Sell for $50,000
- Gain = $40,000 (taxable)

## Types of Basis Rules

### Original Basis
What you paid for an asset (cost basis).

Includes:
- Purchase price
- Transaction costs
- Improvements (real estate)
- Reinvested dividends (mutual funds)

### Carryover Basis (Gifts)

When you **give** an asset during your lifetime:
- **Recipient receives YOUR basis** (carryover)
- Built-in gain transfers with asset
- No step-up occurs

**Example - Gift:**
- Parent's basis: $10,000
- Fair market value: $50,000
- Gift to child
- Child's basis: $10,000 (carryover)
- If child sells for $50,000: $40,000 taxable gain

### Stepped-Up Basis (Inheritance)

When asset passes at **death**:
- **Basis "steps up" to fair market value** at date of death
- Built-in gain eliminated
- One of the most valuable tax benefits

**Example - Inheritance:**
- Parent's basis: $10,000
- Fair market value at death: $50,000
- Asset passes to child at death
- Child's basis: $50,000 (stepped-up)
- If child sells for $50,000: $0 taxable gain

### Stepped-Down Basis

Basis can also step **down**:
- Asset worth less than basis at death
- Loss is permanently lost
- Consider selling before death to capture loss

**Example:**
- Basis: $50,000
- Value at death: $10,000
- Heir's basis: $10,000
- $40,000 loss never realized

## Community Property Double Step-Up

In **community property states**, BOTH halves of community property step up at first spouse's death.

**Example:**
- Couple's basis in CP stock: $100,000
- Value at first death: $500,000
- **Surviving spouse's new basis: $500,000**
- All appreciation eliminated

**Compare to Common Law States:**
- Joint property: Only decedent's half steps up
- Surviving spouse's basis: $50,000 + $250,000 = $300,000
- $200,000 built-in gain remains

### Community Property Trust Option
States like Alaska, Tennessee, South Dakota, Kentucky, and Florida allow married couples to elect CP treatment for trust assets, gaining the double step-up benefit.

## Date of Death vs. Alternate Valuation

### Date of Death (Default)
Basis equals fair market value on date of death.

### Alternate Valuation Date (IRC §2032)
**Option:** Use value 6 months after death.

**Requirements:**
- Must reduce BOTH estate value AND estate tax
- Election applies to entire estate
- Must file estate tax return

**Use case:** Estate values dropped after death.

## Special Basis Rules

### Joint Tenancy (Non-Spouse)
- Full value included in decedent's estate (unless survivor can prove contribution)
- Step-up proportional to amount included

### Surviving Spouse Joint Property
- 50% included in estate
- 50% receives step-up
- Other 50% keeps original basis

### IRD (Income in Respect of Decedent)
No step-up for IRD assets:
- IRAs and 401(k)s
- Unpaid salary/bonuses
- Accounts receivable
- Installment sale proceeds

**These are taxed to beneficiary as ordinary income.**

### S Corporation Stock
- Stock basis steps up
- Inside basis of S corp assets does NOT step up
- Creates complexity for sales

### Partnership Interests
- Outside basis (partnership interest) steps up
- Inside basis (partnership assets) may not step up unless §754 election

## Planning Implications

### Gift vs. Bequest Analysis

| Factor | Gift (Lifetime) | Bequest (Death) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Basis | Carryover | Stepped-up |
| Built-in gain | Transfers | Eliminated |
| Estate tax | Removes from estate | Included in estate |
| Gift/estate tax | Uses exemption | Uses exemption |

**General Rule:**
- Low-basis appreciated assets → Hold until death (step-up)
- High-basis assets → Can gift without tax cost
- Depreciated assets → Sell before death (capture loss)

### Assets to Hold Until Death
- Highly appreciated stock
- Appreciated real estate
- Collectibles with low basis
- Business interests with low basis

### Assets Safe to Gift
- Cash (basis = value)
- Recently purchased assets
- Assets with high basis

### What NOT to Do
- Gift appreciated assets (lose step-up)
- Hold depreciated assets until death (lose loss)
- Contribute appreciated assets to retirement accounts (lose step-up)

## Basis Documentation

### Why It Matters
- Beneficiaries need basis to report sales
- IRS may question claimed basis
- Records may be lost over generations

### What to Document
- Date of death values (appraisals)
- Form 706 values (if filed)
- Purchase records for inherited assets
- Improvement records (real estate)

### Sources for Historical Basis
- Estate tax returns
- Brokerage records
- Property records
- Old tax returns
- Appraisals

## Special Situations

### Assets in Revocable Trust
Full step-up at grantor's death (same as individually owned).

### Assets in Irrevocable Trust
Depends on trust type:
- Grantor trust: Generally steps up
- Non-grantor trust: Generally no step-up
- Intentionally defective grantor trust (IDGT): Complex rules

### Qualified Opportunity Zone Investments
Special basis rules:
- 10-year holding: Step-up to FMV (but must sell before 12/31/2026)
- Deferred gain eventually recognized

### Installment Sales at Death
- Remaining gain is IRD
- No step-up on gain portion
- Heir picks up installments with built-in gain
