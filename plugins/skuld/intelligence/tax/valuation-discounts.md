# Valuation Discounts in Estate Planning

## Overview

Valuation discounts reduce the gift or estate tax value of transferred assets below their pro-rata fair market value. Properly applied, discounts can significantly reduce transfer taxes. Improperly applied, they invite IRS scrutiny and potential penalties.

## What Are Valuation Discounts?

When valuing interests in closely-held businesses or investment entities, the IRS permits discounts reflecting real-world limitations on value.

**Basic Principle:** A 10% interest in a $10 million company is NOT necessarily worth $1 million because:
- A minority owner cannot control the company
- There is no ready market to sell the interest
- Restrictions may limit transferability

## Types of Valuation Discounts

### Discount for Lack of Marketability (DLOM)

**What It Reflects:**
The difference in value between:
- A publicly traded stock (liquid, instant sale)
- A private company interest (no market, difficult to sell)

**Typical Range:** 15-35%

**Factors Affecting DLOM:**
| Factor | Higher Discount | Lower Discount |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Company earnings | Volatile/unpredictable | Stable/consistent |
| Distribution policy | Minimal distributions | Regular dividends |
| Transfer restrictions | Strict limitations | Few restrictions |
| Company size | Smaller operations | Larger operations |
| Management depth | Key person dependent | Strong team |

### Discount for Lack of Control (DLOC) / Minority Interest Discount

**What It Reflects:**
A minority owner cannot:
- Force distributions
- Elect management
- Sell the company
- Change business direction
- Liquidate assets

**Typical Range:** 15-40%

**Factors Affecting DLOC:**
| Ownership Level | Typical Discount |
|-----------------|------------------|
| < 20% | Higher discount |
| 20-49% | Moderate discount |
| 50% (deadlock) | Situational |
| > 50% (control) | No discount |

### Combined Discounts

Discounts are applied sequentially, not additively:

```
Example:
Fair Market Value (pro rata): $1,000,000
DLOC (30%): $1,000,000 × (1 - 0.30) = $700,000
DLOM (25%): $700,000 × (1 - 0.25) = $525,000

Total effective discount: 47.5%
Gift tax value: $525,000 (not $1,000,000)
```

### Fractional Interest Discount

For undivided interests in real estate:
- Co-owners cannot force partition without cost
- Sale requires all owners to agree
- Typical range: 10-30%

### Key Person Discount

When business value depends heavily on one individual:
- Death/departure would reduce company value
- More common for small businesses
- Must be substantiated

## Entities That Generate Discounts

### Family Limited Partnership (FLP)

**Structure:**
- General Partner (GP): Controls operations, typically 1-2%
- Limited Partners (LP): No control, receive distributions

**How Discounts Apply:**
1. Family transfers assets to FLP
2. Parents retain GP interest (control)
3. LP interests gifted/sold to children
4. LP interests valued with discounts

### Family LLC

Similar to FLP but with:
- Manager vs. member distinction
- More flexible state laws
- Single level of liability protection

### S Corporations

Discounts may apply but with limitations:
- Shareholder restrictions
- One class of stock rule
- Fewer planning opportunities

## IRS Requirements and Scrutiny

### Legitimate Business Purpose Required

The IRS challenges entities created **solely** for tax savings. Must have legitimate non-tax purposes:

**Valid Business Purposes:**
- Asset management (multiple real estate properties)
- Creditor protection
- Centralized investment management
- Family governance/succession planning
- Joint venture operations

**Red Flags:**
- Funded on deathbed
- No change in asset management
- No separate entity records
- Commingling of funds
- Grantor retains all economic benefit

### IRS Challenge: Section 2036

Under IRC §2036, assets may be included in estate if decedent retained:
- Right to income
- Right to possession
- Right to designate who receives income

**How to Avoid 2036 Problems:**
- GP receives reasonable compensation only
- Distributions made to all partners proportionally
- Separate books and records maintained
- Annual meetings held
- Entity formalities followed

### IRS Audit Statistics

Estates valued over $10 million face audit rates of approximately 20-22%. Valuation discounts are a primary audit focus.

## Appraisal Requirements

### Qualified Appraiser Standards

For gift/estate tax reporting, use appraiser who:
- Holds appropriate credentials (ASA, MAI, etc.)
- Has experience with similar entities
- Is independent (no interest in outcome)
- Follows professional standards (USPAP)

### Timing of Appraisals

- Gift tax: Valuation date = date of gift
- Estate tax: Valuation date = date of death (or alternate date)
- Annual appraisals recommended for ongoing gifting programs

### What Appraisers Evaluate

**Entity-Level Factors:**
- Financial statements (3-5 years)
- Nature of business/assets
- Distribution history
- Operating agreements/partnership agreements
- Comparable transactions

**Interest-Level Factors:**
- Ownership percentage
- Voting rights
- Transfer restrictions
- Put/call provisions
- Prior transfers of similar interests

## Common Discount Mistakes

### 1. Excessive Discounts

**Problem:** Claiming combined discounts of 50%+ without strong justification.

**Result:** IRS audit, penalties, revaluation.

### 2. Inadequate Documentation

**Problem:** No operating agreement, no meetings, no separate accounts.

**Result:** Entity disregarded, full value included in estate.

### 3. Deathbed Transfers

**Problem:** Entity created or funded shortly before death.

**Result:** Transactions ignored, IRC §2036 inclusion.

### 4. Self-Serving Appraisals

**Problem:** Appraiser with stake in outcome or lacking credentials.

**Result:** Appraisal rejected, penalties applied.

### 5. Ignoring State Law

**Problem:** Partnership/LLC doesn't comply with state requirements.

**Result:** Entity may not be recognized.

## Tennessee-Specific Considerations

### Favorable Entity Laws

Tennessee offers:
- Modern LLC Act
- Strong charging order protection
- No state income tax on partnerships
- Business-friendly court system

### Tennessee DAPT + Dynasty Trust Combination

For sophisticated planning, Tennessee allows:
- Domestic Asset Protection Trust (DAPT)
- Dynasty trusts (360 years)
- Combined with FLP/LLC for layered protection

### Community Property Trust Interaction

If using TN CPT:
- CPT assets could be transferred to FLP/LLC
- Double step-up still available at death
- Discounts may apply to transfers
- Complex interaction - requires specialist

## Planning Context

### When Valuation Discounts May Be Appropriate

- Multi-generation business succession
- Large concentrated positions
- Multiple real estate properties
- Significant family wealth requiring transfer planning
- Legitimate asset management needs

### When Valuation Discounts Are NOT Appropriate

- Sole purpose is tax avoidance
- Estate under federal exemption ($13.99M in 2025)
- Simple assets (marketable securities only)
- Unable to maintain entity formalities
- Unwilling to engage qualified professionals

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Typical Costs

| Item | Estimated Cost |
|------|----------------|
| Entity formation (attorney) | $5,000-20,000 |
| Annual maintenance | $1,000-5,000 |
| Initial appraisal | $5,000-25,000 |
| Annual appraisals | $3,000-10,000 |
| Tax return preparation | $1,000-5,000/year |

### Break-Even Consideration

Rough rule: Discounting strategies typically make sense when:
- Estate exceeds federal exemption by significant amount
- Potential tax savings exceed setup and maintenance costs
- Family is committed to long-term entity maintenance
