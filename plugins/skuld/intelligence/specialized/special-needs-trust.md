# Special Needs Trust Planning

## Overview

A Special Needs Trust (SNT), also called a Supplemental Needs Trust, holds assets for a beneficiary with a disability without disqualifying them from means-tested government benefits like SSI and Medicaid.

## Types of Special Needs Trusts

### Third-Party SNT
Created and funded by someone OTHER than the beneficiary (parents, grandparents, etc.)

**Key Features:**
- No payback requirement to government at beneficiary's death
- Remainder goes to named beneficiaries
- Can be created during lifetime or in will
- Most flexible and favorable

**Funding Sources:**
- Gifts from family
- Inheritance
- Life insurance proceeds
- Any funds NOT belonging to the beneficiary

### First-Party SNT (d)(4)(A) Trust
Created with the beneficiary's OWN assets

**Key Features:**
- **Must have Medicaid payback** provision
- Beneficiary must be under 65 when established
- Must be established by parent, grandparent, guardian, or court
- Used for personal injury settlements, inheritances received directly

**Payback Requirement:**
Upon beneficiary's death, remaining assets repay Medicaid for benefits provided during lifetime

### Pooled Trust (d)(4)(C)
Managed by nonprofit organization

**Key Features:**
- Multiple beneficiaries' funds pooled for investment
- Individual sub-accounts for each beneficiary
- Can be established by beneficiary themselves
- No age limit for joining
- Partial payback requirement (remainder may stay in pool)

## ABLE Accounts

### What is an ABLE Account?
ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) accounts are tax-advantaged savings accounts for individuals with disabilities.

**Key Features (2025):**
- Annual contribution limit: $18,000 (same as gift tax exclusion)
- Total balance limit: Varies by state (typically $300,000-$500,000)
- First $100,000 doesn't count against SSI resource limit
- Tax-free growth if used for qualified disability expenses

### ABLE vs. SNT Comparison

| Feature | ABLE Account | Third-Party SNT |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Contribution limit | $18,000/year | Unlimited |
| Total balance | ~$300,000-$500,000 | Unlimited |
| SSI treatment | First $100,000 excluded | Fully excluded |
| Administration | Self-directed | Trustee managed |
| Cost | Low | Higher (trustee fees) |
| Medicaid payback | Yes (first-party funds) | No (third-party) |
| Setup complexity | Simple | Requires legal drafting |
| Beneficiary control | ✅ Full debit card access | ❌ Trustee decides |
| Investment options | Limited menu | Full flexibility |

**Best Practice:** Use BOTH - ABLE for smaller, routine expenses; SNT for larger funds.

```

**SNT to ABLE Funding:**
- Trustee CAN transfer from SNT to ABLE (up to $18,000/year)
- Counts as qualified distribution from SNT
- Gives beneficiary more autonomy for routine expenses
- Does NOT change SNT's tax status

**529 to ABLE Rollover:**
- Unused 529 education funds can roll to ABLE
- Subject to annual contribution limit
- Beneficiary must be ABLE account owner or family member
- Tax-free if proper rollover

## Government Benefits Protected

### Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
- Resource limit: $2,000 individual / $3,000 couple
- Properly structured SNT assets don't count
- Income rules also apply

### Medicaid
- Means-tested healthcare coverage
- SNT preserves eligibility
- Critical for long-term care

### Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)
- NOT means-tested (based on work history)
- Not affected by SNT assets
- But Medicaid eligibility may still matter

## Allowable Distributions from SNT

### Permitted Distributions
Trustee can pay for items that **supplement** (not supplant) government benefits:

- Additional medical care not covered by Medicaid
- Dental care, vision care
- Personal care attendant (above Medicaid)
- Transportation and vehicles
- Electronics and computers
- Vacations and entertainment
- Education and training
- Home modifications
- Therapy (OT, PT, speech)
- Pet care
- Furniture and household items

### Prohibited Distributions
Trustee should NOT:
- Give cash directly to beneficiary
- Pay for food or shelter (can reduce SSI)
- Make distributions that constitute "income"

**Note:** SSI has complex "In-Kind Support and Maintenance" rules. Food and shelter payments reduce SSI by up to 1/3 + $20 (Presumed Maximum Value).

## Trust Drafting Considerations

### Key Provisions
1. **Discretionary language** - Trustee has sole and absolute discretion
2. **Supplemental purpose** - Explicitly supplement, not supplant
3. **Prohibition on cash distributions**
4. **Spendthrift clause** - Beneficiary cannot assign interest
5. **Payback provision** (first-party only)
6. **Remainder beneficiaries** (third-party only)

### Trustee Selection
Consider:
- Individual (family member, friend)
- Professional trustee (bank, trust company)
- Pooled trust organization
- Co-trustees (individual + professional)

**Critical:** Trustee must understand government benefit rules

## Common Mistakes

1. **Giving inheritance directly to disabled person** - Use third-party SNT instead
2. **Not having payback clause in first-party SNT** - Required by law
3. **Distributing cash** - Should pay providers directly
4. **Paying rent/food without understanding impact** - Reduces SSI
5. **Not coordinating with ABLE account** - Use both for maximum benefit
6. **Wrong type of SNT** - First-party vs. third-party matters
7. **Creating first-party SNT after age 65** - Not allowed

## State Variations

### Tennessee (TennCare)

**TennCare** is Tennessee's Medicaid program with specific rules:

**Transfer Lookback:**
- **5-year lookback** for transfers to SNTs
- Different from DAPT lookback (18 months)
- Transfers during lookback may trigger penalty period

**Waiver Programs:**
| Program | Who It Serves | Focus |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **CHOICES** | Elderly & adults with physical disabilities | Long-term services & supports |
| **ECF** | Adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities | Employment & community integration |
| **Katie Beckett** | Children with disabilities | Home care (alternative to institutional care) |

- Waiver services may provide additional supports beyond standard Medicaid
- ECF especially valuable for employment support and community integration

**Pooled Trust Option:**
- Tennessee has qualified pooled trust options
- Useful for beneficiaries over 65 (cannot create new first-party SNT)
- Some allow remainder to stay in pool rather than Medicaid payback

**ABLE TN + SNT Coordination for Tennessee Families:**

1. **Open ABLE TN first** if beneficiary is eligible
2. **Create Third-Party SNT** for larger assets
3. **Fund SNT → ABLE annually** (up to $18,000) for beneficiary autonomy
4. **Use ABLE for routine expenses** (debit card convenience)
5. **Reserve SNT for major purchases** (vehicles, home mods, travel)

**First-Party ABLE Considerations:**
- If beneficiary's own funds go into ABLE, Medicaid payback applies
- Third-party contributions to ABLE have NO payback
- Consider source of funds when deciding ABLE vs. SNT

### Other State Variations
- Some states have supplemental programs beyond federal
- Medicaid eligibility varies by state
- Some states have pooled trust options
- Check state-specific requirements

## Planning Triggers

Consider SNT when:
- Client has child with disability
- Beneficiary receives means-tested benefits
- Inheritance might go to disabled person
- Personal injury settlement for disabled person
- Parents are aging and haven't planned
