# Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)

## Overview

An Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT) is an irrevocable trust designed to be "defective" for income tax purposes (grantor pays income tax) while being complete for gift/estate tax purposes (assets removed from estate). This dual treatment creates powerful estate planning opportunities.

## What Makes an IDGT "Defective"?

### The Two Tax Systems

Estate planning involves two separate tax systems:

| System | What It Taxes | Relevant IRC Sections |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| Income Tax | Ongoing income, gains | §§671-679 (grantor trust rules) |
| Transfer Tax | Gifts, estates, GST | §§2001-2704 |

### Intentional Defect

The "defect" is created by including trust provisions that trigger grantor trust status for income tax while NOT causing estate inclusion for transfer tax:

**Common Defect Triggers:**
- Power to substitute assets of equivalent value (§675(4)(C))
- Power to borrow without adequate interest/security (§675(2))
- Spouse as beneficiary with certain controls (§677)

**What This Means:**
- **Income Tax:** Grantor pays tax on all trust income
- **Estate Tax:** Trust assets are NOT in grantor's estate
- **Gift Tax:** Initial transfer is a completed gift

### The Installment Sale to IDGT

The most powerful IDGT technique is the installment sale:

**Step 1: Seed the Trust**
- Make initial gift to IDGT (uses exemption)
- Typically 10% of planned assets
- Creates "equity cushion" for sale

**Step 2: Sell Assets to Trust**
- Sell appreciating assets for fair market value
- Receive promissory note in return
- Interest rate: IRS Applicable Federal Rate (AFR)
- No capital gain recognized (grantor trust = disregarded for income tax)

**Step 3: Asset Appreciation**
- Assets grow inside trust
- All appreciation occurs outside estate
- Grantor pays income tax (additional "gift" to trust)

**Step 4: Note Repayment**
- Trust makes principal and interest payments
- Note balance returns to grantor's estate
- Appreciated assets remain in trust

### Why It Works

**Key Tax Benefits:**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Estate Freeze | Asset value frozen at sale date |
| Appreciation Shift | All future growth outside estate |
| Income Tax Subsidy | Grantor paying tax = additional gift |
| No Capital Gain | Sale to grantor trust is non-event |
| Low AFR Rate | Borrowing at AFR vs. commercial rates |

### Example: IDGT in Action

```
Scenario:
- Business interest worth $10 million
- Expected appreciation: 8% annually
- Federal exemption: $13.99 million
- Grantor age: 60

Without IDGT (asset stays in estate):
- 10 years later: $21.6 million value
- Estate tax on excess: Potentially ~$3 million+

With IDGT Sale:
- Year 0: Sell $10M interest to IDGT for note
- Note at AFR (assume 4%): Grantor receives payments
- Year 10: Business worth $21.6 million
- Note balance: Returned to estate (reduces over time)
- Trust holds: $21.6 million (outside estate)
- Estate tax savings: Potentially $3 million+

Additional benefit: Grantor paid income tax on trust earnings,
further reducing taxable estate.
```

## When IDGT May Be Appropriate

### Favorable Indicators

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Estate over exemption | Primary use case - estate tax mitigation |
| Appreciating assets | Shifts future growth outside estate |
| Income-producing assets | Trust can service note payments |
| Long time horizon | More time for appreciation |
| Grantor can pay income tax | Essential for strategy to work |
| Family business | Good candidate for sale to IDGT |

### Best Assets for IDGT

**Ideal:**
- Closely-held business interests (especially with discounts)
- Real estate expected to appreciate
- Pre-IPO stock
- Partnership interests with growth potential

**Acceptable:**
- Dividend-paying securities
- Income-producing investments

**Poor Candidates:**
- Cash (no appreciation potential)
- Assets expected to decline
- Assets grantor needs for living expenses

### Risks and Complications

**Death During Note Term:**
- Outstanding note included in estate
- May trigger estate inclusion issues
- Consider life insurance backup

**IRS Scrutiny:**
- Must be bona fide sale
- Appraisal required for illiquid assets
- Adequate equity cushion needed

**Grantor Trust Status Loss:**
- If grantor trust status terminates, remaining gain recognized
- Trust document must carefully preserve status

**Bankruptcy/Creditor Issues:**
- Recent transfers may be fraudulent conveyance
- Timing matters

## IDGT vs. Other Strategies

| Strategy | Estate Freeze? | Income Tax Paid By | Complexity | Typical Use |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| IDGT | Yes | Grantor | High | Business interests, real estate |
| GRAT | Yes | Trust | Medium | Appreciating assets, zeroed-out |
| SLAT | Yes | Trust (usually) | Medium | Spousal access desired |
| QPRT | Yes (home) | Grantor | Medium | Personal residence |
| FLP/LLC | With gifts | Entity | Medium | Family asset management |

### IDGT vs. GRAT

| Factor | IDGT | GRAT |
|--------|------|------|
| Mortality risk | Note in estate if die | Assets return if die during term |
| GST planning | Good | Poor (ETIP rules) |
| Income tax | Grantor pays | Trust pays (unless grantor) |
| Annual payments | Note payments to grantor | Annuity to grantor |
| Gift tax | On seed gift | Can be zeroed out |

## Tennessee-Specific Considerations

### Advantages of Tennessee IDGT

**No State Income Tax:**
- Tennessee has no state income tax (Hall Tax repealed 2021)
- Grantor pays federal income tax only
- Beneficiaries in income tax states benefit from TN trust

**Dynasty Trust Capability:**
- Tennessee allows trusts up to 360 years
- IDGT can be designed as dynasty trust
- Multi-generational wealth transfer

**DAPT Combination:**
- Tennessee is a Domestic Asset Protection Trust state
- IDGT can incorporate DAPT provisions
- Layered asset protection

### Tennessee Trust Siting

For maximum benefit, Tennessee IDGT should have:
- Tennessee trustee (at least one)
- Tennessee governing law
- Tennessee trust situs

### Documentation Requirements

**At Formation:**
- IDGT agreement
- Initial gift documentation
- Sale agreement
- Promissory note
- Qualified appraisal
- Gift tax return (Form 709)

**Ongoing:**
- Annual interest payments
- Principal payment tracking
- Trust income records
- Grantor's income tax reporting

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Insufficient Equity Cushion

**Problem:** Trust has no assets before sale; note secured only by sold assets.

**IRS Argument:** Not a bona fide sale; just a retained interest.

**Solution:** Seed gift of 10%+ of asset value before sale.

### 2. Below-Market Note Terms

**Problem:** Note rate below AFR or inadequate terms.

**Result:** Recharacterized as part-sale/part-gift; additional gift tax.

**Solution:** Use current AFR rate; proper note documentation.

### 3. Inadequate Appraisal

**Problem:** Assets sold without qualified appraisal.

**Result:** IRS revalues assets; increased gift tax.

**Solution:** Always use qualified appraiser for illiquid assets.

### 4. Grantor Trust Status Failure

**Problem:** Trust loses grantor trust status unexpectedly.

**Result:** Remaining gain recognized; strategy fails.

**Solution:** Careful drafting; maintain all triggering provisions.

### 5. Cash Flow Problems

**Problem:** Grantor cannot pay income tax on trust earnings.

**Result:** Forced trust distributions; loss of benefits.

**Solution:** Plan cash flow before implementing.
