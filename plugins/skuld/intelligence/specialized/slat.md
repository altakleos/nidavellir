# Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT)

## Overview

A Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT) is an irrevocable trust created by one spouse for the benefit of the other spouse (and often descendants). It removes assets from both spouses' estates while allowing indirect access to trust assets through the beneficiary spouse.

## What is a SLAT?

### Basic Concept

A SLAT allows a married person to:
1. Transfer assets to an irrevocable trust
2. Remove those assets from their taxable estate
3. Use lifetime gift/estate tax exemption
4. Still have **indirect access** through their spouse (beneficiary)

### Key Features

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Irrevocable | Cannot be changed or revoked once created |
| Removes from estate | Assets not included in grantor's estate |
| Uses exemption | Gift uses lifetime gift/estate tax exemption |
| Spousal access | Beneficiary spouse can receive distributions |
| Dynasty potential | Can last multiple generations |
| Asset protection | Generally protected from creditors |

## Why Couples Use SLATs

### Primary Motivations

**1. Lock in Current Exemption**
- 2025 exemption: $13.99 million per person
- Concern: Exemption could decrease in future
- SLAT allows using exemption now while maintaining indirect access

**2. Remove Appreciation from Estate**
- Assets transferred at current value
- All future growth outside estate
- Similar benefit to IDGT but with spousal access

**3. Asset Protection**
- Properly structured SLAT protects from:
  - Creditors of grantor spouse
  - Creditors of beneficiary spouse (in most states)
  - Divorce claims (varies by state)

### What Triggers Reciprocal Trust Concerns

The doctrine applies when trusts are:
- Created at or around the same time
- With substantially similar terms
- By spouses for each other's benefit

### How to Differentiate SLATs

If both spouses want to create SLATs, they must be **meaningfully different**:

| Element | Spouse A's SLAT | Spouse B's SLAT |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Timing | January | September+ |
| Amount | $13 million | $10 million |
| Assets | Cash, securities | Real estate |
| Distribution standard | HEMS | Absolute discretion |
| Beneficiaries | Spouse B + all children | Spouse A + only some children |
| Trustee | Corporate trustee | Family member |
| GST allocation | Allocated | Not allocated |

**Minimum Differentiation:** Attorneys recommend at least 3-4 meaningful differences.

## Critical Risk: Divorce

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

### Divorce Mitigation Strategies

Some (but not complete) protection options:

**Trust Protector:**
- Third party with power to remove beneficiaries
- Can remove ex-spouse after divorce
- But: Cannot return assets to grantor

**Limited Power of Appointment:**
- Beneficiary spouse can redirect assets to others
- But: Requires cooperation of beneficiary spouse

**Formula Clauses:**
- Automatically change distributions upon divorce
- But: Enforceability varies by state

**Bottom Line:** No perfect solution. SLAT should only be considered if marriage is rock-solid.

## When SLAT May Be Appropriate

### Favorable Indicators

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Estate significantly over exemption | Primary use case |
| Long, stable marriage | Critical for SLAT to work |
| Want to use exemption now | Locking in current levels |
| Comfortable giving up direct control | Assets are irrevocably transferred |
| Have other assets for retirement | Can't rely solely on SLAT access |
| Trust the beneficiary spouse | Distributions are discretionary |

### Ideal Candidates

- Couples with estates of $20+ million combined
- Married 15+ years with stable relationship
- Have sufficient assets OUTSIDE the SLAT
- Concerned about exemption reduction
- Want generational wealth transfer

## SLAT vs. Other Strategies

| Strategy | Spousal Access? | Estate Freeze? | Complexity | Divorce Risk |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| SLAT | Yes (indirect) | Yes | Medium-High | High |
| IDGT | No | Yes | High | Low |
| GRAT | No (annuity only) | Yes | Medium | Low |
| Joint Revocable Trust | Yes (full) | No | Low | Low |
| Credit Shelter Trust | At death only | At death | Medium | N/A |

## Tennessee-Specific Advantages

### No State Income Tax

Tennessee has no state income tax (Hall Tax repealed 2021):
- Trust income not subject to TN tax
- Beneficiary distributions not TN taxable
- Compare to states like CA (13.3% top rate)

### Dynasty Trust Capability

Tennessee allows trusts lasting 360 years:
- SLAT can be structured as dynasty trust
- Multi-generational wealth transfer
- GST exemption can shelter entire trust

### DAPT Provisions

Tennessee is a Domestic Asset Protection Trust state:
- SLAT can include self-settled spendthrift provisions
- Additional creditor protection layer
- 2-year fraudulent transfer lookback

### Favorable Trust Laws

- Directed trustee statutes
- Trust protector provisions recognized
- Investment advisor flexibility
- Decanting allowed

## Community Property Considerations

### Community Property States

In CP states (AZ, CA, ID, LA, NV, NM, TX, WA, WI, AK-elect):
- Assets may be community property
- Both spouses must consent to transfer
- May need to convert to separate property first

### Tennessee Community Property Trust

If using TN CPT before SLAT:
- Convert assets to community property for step-up
- Then transfer to SLAT
- Complex interaction - requires careful planning

## SLAT Administration

### Ongoing Requirements

**Trustee Duties:**
- Maintain separate trust accounts
- Make discretionary distribution decisions
- File trust tax returns (if non-grantor trust)
- Document all distributions

**Tax Reporting:**
- Gift tax return (Form 709) at creation
- Trust income tax returns annually
- Track exemption usage

### Distribution Standards

Typical SLAT distribution standards:

**HEMS (Health, Education, Maintenance, Support):**
- Ascertainable standard
- Limits trustee discretion
- Generally safer for tax purposes

**Absolute Discretion:**
- Maximum trustee flexibility
- Consider for differentiation from spouse's SLAT
- More exposure to creditor claims in some states

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Creating Reciprocal SLATs

**Problem:** Both spouses create nearly identical SLATs at same time.

**Result:** IRS uncrosses trusts; estate tax benefits lost.

**Solution:** Meaningful differentiation across multiple factors.

### 2. Grantor as Trustee

**Problem:** Grantor serves as trustee of own SLAT.

**Result:** Possible estate inclusion; defeats purpose.

**Solution:** Independent trustee or corporate trustee.

### 3. Inadequate Non-SLAT Assets

**Problem:** Couple transfers too much to SLAT; left with inadequate resources.

**Result:** Over-reliance on discretionary distributions.

**Solution:** Retain sufficient assets outside SLAT for retirement security.

### 4. Poor Beneficiary Spouse Health

**Problem:** Beneficiary spouse dies; spousal access terminates.

**Result:** Grantor loses indirect access.

**Solution:** Consider life expectancy in planning; insurance backup.

### 5. Ignoring Divorce Risk

**Problem:** "It won't happen to us."

**Result:** Divorce; complete loss of access to transferred assets.

**Solution:** Honest evaluation; include protective provisions where possible.
