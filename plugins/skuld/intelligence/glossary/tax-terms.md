| **Inheritance Tax** | State tax paid by the recipient of inherited property (not the estate). Rates vary by relationship to decedent. |
| **Gift Tax** | Federal tax on transfers during lifetime. Shares lifetime exemption with estate tax. Annual exclusion of $19,000 per recipient (2025). |
| **Portability** | Ability to transfer unused federal estate tax exemption to surviving spouse. Requires filing Form 706 even if no tax is due. |
| **Annual Exclusion** | Amount that can be gifted each year to any person without using lifetime exemption or filing gift tax return. $19,000 per recipient in 2025. |
| **Lifetime Exemption** | Total amount that can be transferred (by gift during life or at death) without incurring federal estate/gift tax. $13.99M in 2025. |
| **Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax** | Additional tax on transfers to grandchildren or more remote descendants (or trusts for their benefit). Prevents skipping estate tax for a generation. |
| **Marital Deduction** | Unlimited deduction for transfers between spouses. Spouse must be US citizen or use QDOT. |
| **Charitable Deduction** | Unlimited deduction for transfers to qualified charities. Reduces taxable estate dollar-for-dollar. |
| **QDOT** | Qualified Domestic Trust. Required for marital deduction when spouse is not a US citizen. Special rules apply. |
| **Cliff Tax (NY)** | New York provision where entire state estate tax exemption is lost if estate exceeds 105% of threshold. Creates effective tax rates over 100% near threshold. |
| **IDGT** | Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust. An irrevocable trust "defective" for income tax purposes (grantor pays income tax) but effective for estate tax (assets removed from estate). Used to freeze asset values and shift appreciation. |
| **SLAT** | Spousal Lifetime Access Trust. An irrevocable trust created by one spouse for the other spouse's benefit. Removes assets from estate while allowing indirect access through distributions to beneficiary spouse. |
| **DLOM** | Discount for Lack of Marketability. Valuation discount reflecting that a privately held interest cannot be readily sold on a public market. Typically ranges 15-35%. |
| **DLOC** | Discount for Lack of Control (also: Minority Interest Discount). Valuation discount reflecting that a minority owner cannot control business decisions. Typically ranges 15-40%. |
| **Tax Apportionment** | The allocation of estate taxes among beneficiaries based on the benefit they receive. Determines who bears the tax burden when estate owes estate tax. |
| **AFR** | Applicable Federal Rate. IRS-published interest rates used for family loans and installment sales. Using AFR avoids gift tax treatment of below-market loans. |
| **Grantor Trust** | Trust where the grantor is treated as owner for income tax purposes. The grantor pays income tax on trust income even though assets are outside their estate. |
| **Unified Credit** | The tax credit that offsets estate and gift tax on transfers up to the exemption amount. "Unified" because lifetime gifts and estate use the same exemption. |
| **DSUE** | Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion. The unused portion of a deceased spouse's estate tax exemption that can be transferred to the surviving spouse through portability election. |
| **Form 706** | Federal Estate Tax Return. Required for estates exceeding the exemption threshold or to elect portability. Due 9 months after death (6-month extension available). |
| **Form 709** | Federal Gift Tax Return. Required when gifts exceed annual exclusion or when gift-splitting between spouses. Due April 15 of year following gift. |
