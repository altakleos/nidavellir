# Beneficiary Designation Coordination Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist ensures your beneficiary designations on retirement accounts and life insurance policies align with your estate plan. **Beneficiary designations override your trust and will** - if they conflict, the designations control.

## Section A: Retirement Accounts

### Account Inventory

For each retirement account, gather:
- Account type (401(k), IRA, Roth IRA, 403(b), etc.)
- Financial institution
- Account number (last 4 digits)
- Current primary beneficiary
- Current contingent beneficiary

| Account Type | Institution | Last 4 | Primary Beneficiary | Contingent | Needs Update? |
|--------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|------------|---------------|
| [TYPE] | [INSTITUTION] | [XXXX] | [NAME] | [NAME] | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| [TYPE] | [INSTITUTION] | [XXXX] | [NAME] | [NAME] | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| [TYPE] | [INSTITUTION] | [XXXX] | [NAME] | [NAME] | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| [TYPE] | [INSTITUTION] | [XXXX] | [NAME] | [NAME] | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| [TYPE] | [INSTITUTION] | [XXXX] | [NAME] | [NAME] | [ ] Yes [ ] No |

### Coordination Questions

**For married clients:**
- [ ] Is your spouse the primary beneficiary? (Required for 401(k)/403(b) unless spouse consents in writing)
- [ ] Does the contingent beneficiary match your trust's distribution plan?
- [ ] If naming trust as beneficiary, have you verified it qualifies as a "see-through" trust?

**For clients with minor children:**
- [ ] Are you naming a trust (not minors directly) as contingent beneficiary?
- [ ] Does the trust include UTMA/custodial provisions for minors?

**For clients with special needs beneficiaries:**
- [ ] Have you named the Special Needs Trust (NOT the individual) as beneficiary?
- [ ] Is the SNT properly drafted as a "conduit" or "accumulation" trust for stretch IRA purposes?

**For blended families:**
- [ ] Do designations match your intended split between spouse and children from prior marriage?
- [ ] Consider: Spouse as primary, children as contingent (or specific percentages)

---

## Section B: Life Insurance Policies

### Policy Inventory

| Policy Type | Company | Policy # (last 4) | Face Amount | Primary Beneficiary | Contingent | Needs Update? |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|------------|---------------|
| [Term/Whole/etc.] | [COMPANY] | [XXXX] | $[AMOUNT] | [NAME] | [NAME] | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| [Term/Whole/etc.] | [COMPANY] | [XXXX] | $[AMOUNT] | [NAME] | [NAME] | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| [Term/Whole/etc.] | [COMPANY] | [XXXX] | $[AMOUNT] | [NAME] | [NAME] | [ ] Yes [ ] No |

### Coordination Questions

**For all clients:**
- [ ] Should the trust be named as beneficiary for coordinated estate distribution?
- [ ] If naming individuals, does the split match your trust's distribution plan?

**For high net worth clients:**
- [ ] Should life insurance be owned by an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)?
- [ ] Note: ILIT must be the owner AND beneficiary to exclude from taxable estate

**For clients with special needs beneficiaries:**
- [ ] Is the Special Needs Trust named as beneficiary (NOT the individual)?
- [ ] Is there a Letter of Intent directing how proceeds should be used?

## Section C: Common Coordination Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Trust Provides for Spouse, Then Children Equally

**Recommended designation:**
- Primary: Spouse (100%)
- Contingent: [TRUST_NAME] Revocable Living Trust dated [DATE]

### Scenario 2: Blended Family with QTIP Trust

**Recommended designation:**
- Primary: Spouse (income beneficiary under QTIP)
- Contingent: [TRUST_NAME] (which distributes per QTIP terms to children)

*Or, if you want direct control:*
- Primary: Spouse (X%)
- Primary: Children from prior marriage (Y%)

### Scenario 3: Special Needs Beneficiary

**Recommended designation:**
- Primary: [NAME] Special Needs Trust dated [DATE], [TRUSTEE_NAME] as Trustee
- Contingent: Other beneficiaries per trust terms

**NEVER:** Name the disabled individual directly

### Scenario 4: Minor Children as Ultimate Beneficiaries

**Recommended designation:**
- Primary: Spouse (if applicable)
- Contingent: [TRUST_NAME] (which holds funds in subtrusts until distribution ages)

**NEVER:** Name minors directly (they cannot receive proceeds without court intervention)

## Section D: SECURE Act Considerations (2020+)

The SECURE Act changed distribution rules for inherited retirement accounts:

### Eligible Designated Beneficiaries (EDBs)
These beneficiaries can still "stretch" distributions over life expectancy:
- [ ] Surviving spouse
- [ ] Minor children of account owner (until majority, then 10-year rule)
- [ ] Disabled or chronically ill beneficiaries
- [ ] Beneficiaries not more than 10 years younger than account owner

### Non-Eligible Designated Beneficiaries
Must withdraw all funds within 10 years:
- [ ] Adult children
- [ ] Grandchildren
- [ ] Siblings
- [ ] Non-EDB trusts

### Planning Considerations
- [ ] For large retirement accounts, consider Roth conversions to reduce tax burden on heirs
- [ ] For EDBs, consider naming them directly (not through trust) to preserve stretch
- [ ] For SNT beneficiaries, ensure trust is properly drafted as "applicable multi-beneficiary trust"

---

## Section E: Action Items

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Gather all current beneficiary designation forms
- [ ] Compare each designation to trust distribution plan
- [ ] Identify accounts needing updates
- [ ] Request new beneficiary designation forms from each institution

### Updates to Make
| Account/Policy | Current Beneficiary | Change To | Form Requested? | Completed? |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| [ACCOUNT] | [CURRENT] | [NEW] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ACCOUNT] | [CURRENT] | [NEW] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ACCOUNT] | [CURRENT] | [NEW] | [ ] | [ ] |

### After Trust Execution
- [ ] Update designations AFTER trust is signed (so trust date is accurate)
- [ ] Keep copies of all completed designation forms
- [ ] Store copies with your estate planning documents
- [ ] Calendar annual review of designations

## Section F: Sample Beneficiary Designation Language

### Naming a Trust as Beneficiary

**Correct format:**
```
[TRUST_NAME] Revocable Living Trust dated [MM/DD/YYYY],
[TRUSTEE_NAME] as Trustee, or their successors in trust
```

**Example:**
```
The Smith Family Revocable Living Trust dated January 15, 2025,
John M. Smith and Mary E. Smith as Co-Trustees, or their successors in trust
```

### Naming a Special Needs Trust as Beneficiary

**Correct format:**
```
[BENEFICIARY_NAME] Special Needs Trust, a sub-trust of
[PARENT_TRUST_NAME] dated [DATE], [SNT_TRUSTEE_NAME] as Trustee
```

**Example:**
```
James Thomas Miller Special Needs Trust, a sub-trust of
The Miller Family Revocable Living Trust dated March 1, 2025,
Emily Rose Miller as Trustee
```

## Attorney Review Notes

```
[[ ATTORNEY REVIEW: Verify beneficiary designation language matches
   trust terms and qualifies for intended tax treatment ]]

[[ ATTORNEY REVIEW: For large IRAs, confirm trust qualifies as
   "see-through" trust for distribution purposes ]]

[[ ATTORNEY REVIEW: For SNT beneficiaries, confirm trust qualifies as
   "applicable multi-beneficiary trust" under SECURE Act ]]
```

---

## Annual Review Reminder

Review beneficiary designations whenever:
- You update your trust
- Marriage, divorce, or domestic partner changes
- Birth or adoption of child
- Death of a named beneficiary
- Change in beneficiary's circumstances (disability, financial issues)
- Change in your financial situation
- Move to a different state
- At least annually as general practice
