## Types of Louisiana Testaments

Louisiana recognizes two main types of valid testaments:

### 1. Notarial Testament (Most Common)

**Requirements (La. C.C. Art. 1577):**
- Written (typed or handwritten)
- Signed by the testator at the end and on each separate page
- Witnessed by **2 competent witnesses**
- Executed in presence of a **notary public**
- **Read aloud** in the presence of testator, witnesses, and notary
- Dated

**Advantages:**
- Most reliable and commonly accepted
- Self-proving (no witness testimony needed at probate)
- Immediately effective upon death

### 2. Olographic Testament

**Requirements (La. C.C. Art. 1575):**
- **Entirely handwritten** by the testator
- Signed and dated by the testator
- No witnesses or notary required

**Advantages:**
- Simple and private
- No formal execution ceremony
- Can be done at any time

**Disadvantages:**
- Easier to challenge
- May require witness testimony at probate
- Risk of handwriting disputes

---

## Forced Heirship in Louisiana

**Louisiana protects certain heirs through "forced heirship":**

### Forced Heirs (La. C.C. Art. 1493)

Children who are forced heirs:
1. Children **under 24 years of age** at time of parent's death
2. Children of **any age** who are permanently incapable of caring for themselves due to mental incapacity or physical infirmity

### Forced Portion (Legitime)

| Number of Forced Heirs | Forced Portion |
|------------------------|----------------|
| 1 forced heir | 25% of estate |
| 2+ forced heirs | 50% of estate |

**Important:** Only the forced portion is protected. The remaining portion (disposable portion) may be left to anyone.

### Disinherison

Forced heirs may be disinherited only for **just cause** (La. C.C. Art. 1621), such as:
- Attempted to kill the parent
- Accused parent of a capital crime (when false)
- Minor married without consent
- Refused to provide support to parent when able

---

## Surviving Spouse Rights

Louisiana treats the surviving spouse differently than common law states:

### Usufruct (Not Ownership)

**Default rule:** Surviving spouse receives a **usufruct** over:
- Deceased spouse's share of community property
- Separate property if no forced heirs exist

**Usufruct means:**
- Right to use and enjoy the property
- Right to income from the property
- Cannot sell or dispose of the property (that belongs to "naked owners")
- Terminates upon death or remarriage

### Marital Portion

If the surviving spouse is in need, they may claim a **marital portion** equal to the lesser of:
- 1/4 of the estate, or
- $1,000,000

**Limitations:**
- Not available if spouse has assets of comparable value
- May be reduced if surviving spouse's assets are substantial

## Key Differences from Common Law Wills

| Common Law (49 States) | Louisiana Civil Law |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Will | Testament |
| Executor | Executor (same term) |
| Probate | Succession |
| Guardian | Tutor |
| -- | Undertutor (required) |
| Specific bequest | Particular legacy |
| Outright ownership to spouse | Usufruct to spouse, naked ownership to heirs |
| Disinherit children freely | Forced heirship protects certain children |
| Power of Attorney | Mandate/Procuration |

---

## Generator Notes

When generating Louisiana testaments:

1. **Use civil law terminology** - Testament, not Will; Tutor, not Guardian
2. **Address forced heirship** - Identify forced heirs, calculate legitime
3. **Include usufruct provisions** - Surviving spouse typically gets usufruct, not ownership
4. **Require notarial execution** - Read aloud requirement is critical
5. **Include undertutor** - Required for minor children
6. **Reference Louisiana Civil Code** - Not common law principles
