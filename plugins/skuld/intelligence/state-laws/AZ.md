## Key Features

### Community Property State

- Each spouse owns 50%
- Double step-up in basis at death
- Can agree to treat separate as community (and vice versa)

### No State Death Taxes
- No estate tax
- No inheritance tax
- Tax-friendly state for wealth transfer

### Beneficiary Deed
- Arizona has transfer-on-death deed for real estate
- Avoids probate while retaining control
- Revocable during lifetime
- Very popular planning tool

## Elective Share
- No traditional elective share
- Community property protections instead
- Surviving spouse owns 50% of community automatically

## Common Considerations
1. Document community vs. separate property
2. Use beneficiary deeds for real estate probate avoidance
3. Consider community property trust for separate property
4. Snowbird planning (dual-state residence issues)
