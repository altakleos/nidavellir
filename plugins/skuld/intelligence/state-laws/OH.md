## Key Features

### No State Estate Tax
- Ohio repealed estate tax effective January 1, 2013
- Only federal estate tax applies
- Previously had $338,333 exemption (very low)
- Repeal simplifies planning significantly

### Spousal Elective Share
Ohio uses an augmented estate approach:
- Surviving spouse can elect against will
- **Net estate formula**:
  - If children from current marriage only: 1/2 if one child, 1/3 if two+ children
  - If children from prior relationship: 1/3 minimum
  - If no children: 1/2 of estate
- Includes some nonprobate transfers in calculation

## Power of Attorney

### Statutory Form
- Ohio Revised Code § 1337.60
- Notarization required
- No witness requirement
- Durable by default unless stated otherwise
- Immediate effectiveness recommended

### Agent Powers
- Specific enumeration recommended
- Gift-making authority must be explicit
- Real estate powers should be clearly stated

## Healthcare Documents

### Healthcare Power of Attorney
- Can use notarization OR two witnesses (not both required)
- Names healthcare agent (called "attorney in fact")
- Separate from financial POA

### Living Will Declaration
- Ohio has statutory form
- Two witnesses OR notary
- Applies to terminal condition or permanently unconscious state

## Probate

### Full Administration

- Executor called "fiduciary"

### Summary Release from Administration

2. **Forgetting TOD deed benefits** - Simple probate avoidance tool
3. **Not understanding elective share** - Complex calculation in Ohio
4. **Healthcare directive ambiguity** - Either witnesses OR notary, not both required
5. **Assuming old estate tax rules** - Repealed in 2013
