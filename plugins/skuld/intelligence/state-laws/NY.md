## CRITICAL: Estate Tax Cliff

New York has a unique "cliff" provision that can be devastating:

### How the Cliff Works
- 2025 exemption: **$7.16 million**
- Cliff threshold: **105% of exemption = $7.518 million**
- If estate exceeds cliff: **ENTIRE exemption is lost**

| Estate Value | Tax Result |
|--------------|------------|
| ≤ $7,160,000 | No NY estate tax |
| $7,160,001 - $7,518,000 | Tax only on excess |
| ≥ $7,518,001 | **Entire estate taxed** - exemption lost |

### Cliff Example
- Estate of $7.5M → ~$200,000 in tax (only excess taxed)
- Estate of $7.6M → ~$600,000 in tax (entire estate taxed)
- $100,000 more in assets = $400,000 more in tax

### Cliff Planning Strategies
- Charitable bequests to reduce below cliff
- Life insurance in irrevocable trust
- Lifetime gifting (but consider 3-year rule)
- Disclaimer planning

## Right of Election (Elective Share)

Surviving spouse can elect against the will:
- **Greater of $50,000 or 1/3 of net estate**
- Includes augmented estate (some nonprobate assets)
- Can be waived by prenuptial agreement
- 6-month election period

## Will Execution Ceremony

New York is strict about will execution. Recommended ceremony:

1. Testator declares document is their will
2. Testator requests witnesses to witness
3. Testator signs at end of will (or acknowledges prior signature)
4. Each witness signs in presence of testator
5. Testator and witnesses all remain present throughout
6. Complete attestation clause
7. Optional: self-proving affidavit (notarized)

### Common Execution Errors
- Witnesses not present simultaneously
- Testator not declaring it's a will
- Missing attestation clause
- Witnesses signing before testator

## Statutory Power of Attorney

New York requires specific statutory form (or substantially similar):
- Short form + modifications approach
- **Statutory Gifts Rider** required for gifting authority
- Two witnesses AND notary required
- Banks often refuse non-statutory forms

### Major Gifts Rider
- Required for gifts exceeding annual exclusion
- Must be separately signed and acknowledged
- Very specific language required

## Healthcare Proxy

New York separates healthcare documents:
- **Health Care Proxy**: Names agent for medical decisions
- **Living Will**: Not required but recommended
- Proxy form is statutory - recommended to use exact form

### Healthcare Proxy Requirements
- Two witnesses
- Witnesses cannot be appointed agent
- Notarization not required

## Surrogate's Court

Probate handled by Surrogate's Court in each county:
- Supervised estate administration
- Can be slow in NYC boroughs
- SCPA (Surrogate's Court Procedure Act) governs

### Estate Administration Options
- Preliminary letters (temporary authority)
- Full letters testamentary
- Small estate: summary proceeding under $50,000

## Special Considerations

### EPTL (Estates, Powers and Trusts Law)
- Comprehensive statute governing estates
- Frequently referenced in documents

### Three-Year Rule
- Gifts within 3 years of death may be included in NY taxable estate
- Different from federal rule
- Impacts cliff planning

### Non-Domiciliary Tax
- NY taxes real and tangible property located in NY
- Even if decedent was not NY resident

### STAR Exemption
- School tax relief program
- Enhanced STAR for seniors
- Registration now required

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Not accounting for cliff** - Estate barely over threshold loses all exemption
2. **Using non-statutory POA** - Banks refuse it
3. **Forgetting Gifts Rider** - POA can't make gifts
4. **Improper will execution** - Will contested successfully
5. **Not updating for cliff inflation** - Threshold changes annually
6. **Joint accounts with adult children** - Gift and estate tax issues

## Cooperative Apartments

Unique to NYC area:
- Co-op shares are personal property, not real estate
- Board approval may be required for transfers
- Trust ownership may be restricted by co-op
- Review proprietary lease and house rules

## Witness Requirements

Witnesses must:
- Be 18+ years old
- Be competent
- Sign within 30 days of testator (unusual rule)
- Sign in presence of testator
- Understand they are witnessing a will
