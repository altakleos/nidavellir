### Inheritance Tax

- **Class B**: Siblings, nieces/nephews (4%-16% after $1,000 exemption)
- **Class C**: Others (6%-16% after $500 exemption)
- Charity exempt

### Community Property Trust Option
- Kentucky allows opt-in community property treatment (since 2020)
- Married couples can elect CP for trust assets
- Provides double step-up in basis benefit

### Transfer on Death Deed
- Kentucky does NOT have TOD deed for real estate
- Must use trust or joint ownership

## Elective Share
- Surviving spouse: 1/2 of surplus estate (net of debts and costs)
- Plus use of 1/3 of real property for life (dower)

## Common Considerations
1. Inheritance tax for non-lineal beneficiaries (siblings, friends)
2. Community property trust option for step-up benefits
3. No TOD deed - use trust for real estate
4. Dower rights can complicate real estate
