- Determines if Prop 19 reassessment applies

**Prop 19 Impact on Recording:**
- Primary residence to child: Exclusion available IF child occupies within 1 year

## State-Specific Forms Required

| Form | Statute | Purpose | Required | Where to Obtain |
|------|---------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Change of Ownership Statement | BOE-502-A | Property tax assessment | Yes (within 90 days) | County Assessor; CA Franchise Tax Board |
| Preliminary Change of Ownership Report | PCOR | Required with deed in some counties | Varies | County Recorder |
| Advance Health Care Directive | Probate Code § 4670 | Healthcare POA + Living Will | No (but recommended) | CA Secretary of State; State Bar of California |
| Statutory Durable POA | Probate Code § 4401 | Financial power of attorney | No (but required for acceptance) | State Bar of California; legal forms providers |
| Affidavit for Real Property (Small Estate) | Probate Code § 13200 | Real property <$184,500 | Conditional | County Superior Court |
| Small Estate Affidavit | Probate Code § 13100 | Personal property <$184,500 | Conditional | County Superior Court |

### Form Notes

**BOE-502-A (Change of Ownership Statement) - CRITICAL:**
- Most important post-signing form in California
- Failure to file = potential reassessment to current FMV
- Claims parent-child exclusion (Prop 58/193) if applicable
- Prop 19 (2020) significantly limited parent-child exclusions
- File even if you believe transfer is exempt—let assessor confirm

**Preliminary Change of Ownership Report (PCOR):**
- Some counties require PCOR at time of deed recording
- Streamlined version of BOE-502-A
- Does NOT replace BOE-502-A (both may be required)

**Statutory Durable POA:**
- Use statutory short form for maximum institutional acceptance
- Banks and financial institutions often reject non-statutory forms
- Include special instructions as needed via attached schedule
- Agent should sign acceptance

**Advance Health Care Directive:**
- Combines healthcare agent + living will + HIPAA
- Two witnesses required (cannot be healthcare provider, operator of facility, or agent)
- Alternative: Notarization instead of witnesses
- Register with California Secretary of State (optional but recommended)

## Community Property Rules

California is a community property state:
- All property acquired during marriage presumed community property
- Each spouse owns 50% of community property
- Each spouse can will away only their 50%
- **Double step-up in basis**: Both halves get stepped-up basis at first death

### Community Property with Right of Survivorship (CPWROS)
- Alternative to joint tenancy for married couples
- Avoids probate like joint tenancy
- Retains double step-up in basis (joint tenancy only gets 50% step-up)
- Must be specifically titled as CPWROS

### Separate Property
- Property owned before marriage
- Gifts and inheritances during marriage
- Property acquired with separate property funds (must trace)

## Prop 19 (November 2020)

**Major changes to property tax reassessment:**

### Parent-Child Exclusion (Limited)
- Before Prop 19: Unlimited transfer of primary residence + $1M of other property without reassessment
- After Prop 19: Only primary residence qualifies; child must use as primary residence within 1 year
- Value cap: If FMV exceeds taxable value + $1M, difference is added to assessment

### 55+ Portability (Expanded)
- Can transfer base year value anywhere in California (was limited counties)
- Can use up to 3 times (was once)
- If new home costs more, difference is added to transferred value

### Planning Impact
- Rental property transfers to children NOW face reassessment
- Primary residence exclusion requires child to actually live there
- Consider transfers before death if Prop 19 applies unfavorably

## Trust Funding - Real Estate

### Change of Ownership Statement
- **Form BOE-502-A** required within 90 days of trust transfer
- Claim Prop 58/193 parent-child exclusion if applicable
- File with County Assessor

### Recording Requirements
- Record deed with County Recorder
- Documentary transfer tax may apply ($0.55 per $500 of value)
- Some cities have additional transfer taxes

## Probate Thresholds

| Asset Value | Procedure |
|-------------|-----------|
| ≤ $184,500 (2024) | Affidavit procedure (no probate) |
| ≤ $184,500 real property | Simplified court petition |
| > $184,500 | Full probate required |

Threshold adjusts annually for inflation.

## Statutory Fees (Probate)

California has statutory fee schedule for executors and attorneys:
- 4% of first $100,000
- 3% of next $100,000
- 2% of next $800,000
- 1% of next $9,000,000
- 0.5% of next $15,000,000

For $1M estate: approximately $46,000 in statutory fees (executor + attorney combined)

## Special Considerations

### California Statutory Will
- Preprinted form available
- Valid but very limited options
- Trust-based planning generally preferred

### Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT)
- California recognizes QPRTs
- Can reduce estate tax on primary residence
- Consider for estates approaching federal exemption

### Domestic Partnership
- Treated same as marriage for estate planning purposes
- Same community property rules apply

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting Change of Ownership Statement** - Penalties apply
2. **Not updating after Prop 19** - Old estate plans may have unintended tax consequences
3. **Unfunded trust** - Many CA trusts never get fully funded
4. **Joint tenancy with non-spouse** - Loses community property step-up advantage
5. **Overlooking city transfer taxes** - SF, LA have additional taxes

## Witness Requirements

Witnesses must:
- Be 18+ years old
- Not be beneficiaries under the will
- Sign in testator's presence
- Observe testator sign or acknowledge signature
