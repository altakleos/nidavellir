## CRITICAL: Inheritance Tax

Pennsylvania is one of few states with an inheritance tax (not estate tax):

### Tax Rates by Relationship

| Beneficiary Class | Tax Rate |
|-------------------|----------|
| Surviving spouse | **0%** (exempt) |
| Lineal descendants (children, grandchildren) | **4.5%** |
| Siblings | **12%** |
| All others (nieces, nephews, friends) | **15%** |

### Key Features
- Tax is on the RECIPIENT based on relationship
- No exemption threshold - applies to first dollar
- Due within **9 months** of death
- 5% discount if paid within 3 months

### What's Taxed
- Probate assets
- Jointly held property (proportionate to decedent's contribution)
- Life insurance payable to estate
- Revocable trust assets
- Transfers within 1 year of death

### What's NOT Taxed
- Life insurance payable to named beneficiary (not estate)
- Property transferred more than 1 year before death
- Surviving spouse's share
- Charitable bequests

### Planning Implications
- Life insurance to named beneficiaries avoids tax
- Gifts more than 1 year before death avoid tax
- Consider relationship of beneficiaries in planning
- Trusts do NOT avoid PA inheritance tax

## Elective Share

Surviving spouse can elect:
- **1/3 of estate** if decedent has descendants
- **1/2 of estate** if no descendants
- Election against will (or intestate share, whichever is larger)

## Real Estate Transfer Tax

When funding trust with real estate:
- **1% state tax** applies
- Local tax varies (typically 1% additional)
- Total often 2% on real estate transfers
- Exemption for transfers to revocable trust during lifetime (nominal consideration)

## Power of Attorney

Pennsylvania updated POA laws significantly:
- Statutory form available (20 Pa.C.S. § 5601.1)
- Two witnesses required
- Notarization required
- Financial institutions must accept valid POA (penalties for refusal)

### Agent Acknowledgment
- Recommended that agent sign acknowledgment
- Reduces later disputes about authority

## Healthcare Documents

### Combined Advance Directive
- Pennsylvania allows combining:
  - Living will (end-of-life wishes)
  - Healthcare power of attorney (agent designation)
  - HIPAA authorization
- Two witnesses recommended
- Notarization recommended

### POLST (TPOPP in PA)
- Pennsylvania Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment
- Called "TPOPP" in PA
- Medical order for seriously ill patients
- Signed by physician

## Probate

### Register of Wills
- Each county has Register of Wills
- Probate filed in county of decedent's residence
- Will must be filed within specified time

### Small Estate Threshold
- $50,000 or less: simplified petition
- No independent administration like some states

### Orphans' Court
- Handles contested matters
- Trust disputes
- Guardianship matters

## Special Considerations

### Tenancy by the Entirety
- Available for married couples
- Provides creditor protection
- Property passes automatically to survivor

### Pennsylvania Uniform Trust Act
- Adopted modern trust law
- Trust protector provisions
- Decanting available

### Medicaid Planning
- 5-year lookback period
- Careful planning needed for long-term care

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Underestimating inheritance tax** - 4.5% on everything to children
2. **Not paying tax timely** - Miss 5% discount, penalties accrue
3. **Life insurance payable to estate** - Becomes taxable
4. **Transfers within 1 year** - Taxed anyway
5. **Overlooking real estate transfer tax** when funding trust
6. **Using out-of-state POA forms** - May be rejected

## Trust Funding and Inheritance Tax

Important: Transfers to revocable trust:
- During lifetime: No inheritance tax (exempt)
- At death: Trust assets ARE subject to inheritance tax
- Trust does NOT avoid PA inheritance tax
- Trust DOES avoid probate

## Witness Requirements

Witnesses must:
- Be 18+ years old
- Be competent
- Be disinterested (recommended, not required)
- Sign in testator's presence
- Testator must sign at end (after dispositive provisions)
