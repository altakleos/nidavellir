╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║     TENNESSEE COMMUNITY PROPERTY TRUST - UNIQUE TAX BENEFIT      ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Tennessee's Community Property Trust Act (2010) allows married   ║
║ couples to elect community property treatment for trust assets,  ║
║ even though Tennessee is a common law property state.            ║
║                                                                  ║
║ KEY BENEFITS:                                                    ║
║ 1. Double Step-Up in Basis - BOTH halves get FMV at first death ║
║ 2. Capital Gains Elimination - Heirs avoid gains on appreciation║
║ 3. No State Tax Cost - TN has no income or estate tax           ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### How It Works

**Without Community Property Trust (Common Law):**
- Only deceased spouse's half gets step-up in basis
- Survivor's half retains original cost basis
- Potential capital gains tax on survivor's appreciation

**With Community Property Trust:**
- BOTH halves get step-up in basis at first spouse's death
- All pre-death appreciation escapes capital gains tax
- Significant tax savings for appreciated assets

### Example Calculation

```
Asset: $500,000 stock portfolio
Original basis: $100,000 (cost when purchased)

SCENARIO A - Without Community Property Trust:
├── Deceased spouse's half: $250,000 (gets step-up to $250,000)
├── Surviving spouse's half: $50,000 basis (no step-up)
├── Combined basis at first death: $300,000
└── If sold for $500,000: $200,000 taxable gain (~$30,000+ tax)

SCENARIO B - With Community Property Trust:
├── Deceased spouse's half: $250,000 (gets step-up to $250,000)
├── Surviving spouse's half: $250,000 (ALSO gets step-up!)
├── Combined basis at first death: $500,000
└── If sold for $500,000: $0 taxable gain (TAX SAVINGS: ~$30,000+)
```

### Who Should Consider

**Ideal Candidates:**
- Married couples with appreciated assets (stocks, real estate, business interests)
- Couples where one spouse is likely to die first (age gap, health conditions)
- Couples with low-basis assets accumulated during marriage
- Long-term married couples with significant unrealized gains

**Who Should NOT Use:**

⚠️ **High Divorce Risk:**
- Community property means 50/50 split if divorced
- May be disadvantageous if one spouse brought more assets

⚠️ **Litigation-Prone Professions:**
- May prefer separate property for asset protection
- Common law tenancy by entirety may provide better protection

⚠️ **Couples Who May Move:**
- Other states may not recognize TN community property trust
- Could complicate estate planning if relocating

### Important Considerations

**Irrevocable Election:**
- Once assets are transferred to a community property trust, the election is generally irrevocable for those assets
- Cannot easily undo the community property characterization

### CPT Suitability Checklist

Before recommending CPT, verify ALL of the following:

| Criterion | Favorable | Unfavorable |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Marriage Stability** | Long, stable marriage | Recent marriage, prior divorces, current difficulties |
| **Relocation Plans** | Plan to stay in TN | May relocate out of state |
| **Asset Source** | Most assets acquired during marriage | Significant pre-marital/inherited assets |
| **Liability Exposure** | Low-risk profession | Doctor, attorney, business owner with guarantees |
| **Estate Size** | Appreciated assets (basis < FMV) | Mostly cash/recently purchased assets |
| **Beneficiaries** | Same beneficiaries for both spouses | Different intended beneficiaries |

**Score:**
- 5-6 Favorable → CPT likely beneficial
- 3-4 Favorable → Discuss with attorney, weigh tradeoffs
- 0-2 Favorable → CPT likely not appropriate, consider alternatives

**Alternatives to CPT:**
- **Tenancy by Entirety:** Better creditor protection, still has survivorship
- **Joint Trust without CPT:** Standard step-up (only deceased spouse's half)
- **Separate Trusts:** Asset protection, different beneficiary flexibility

**Attorney Review Required:**
```
[[ ATTORNEY REVIEW: Community property election has significant legal and tax
   implications. Ensure couple fully understands the irrevocable nature and
   tradeoffs before electing. Consider impact of potential divorce or
   relocation to another state. ]]
```

### Community Property Trust Option
Tennessee allows married couples to opt into community property:
- Tennessee Community Property Trust Act (2010)
- Creates community property for trust assets
- Provides step-up in basis benefit at first death
- Unique planning opportunity

## TennCare (Tennessee Medicaid)

### Overview
TennCare is Tennessee's Medicaid program with specific planning implications.

### Transfer Lookback
- **5-year lookback** for all transfers
- Applies to gifts, trust funding, and asset transfers
- Different from DAPT lookback (18 months for creditors)
- Transfers during lookback may trigger penalty period

### Waiver Programs
Tennessee offers several home and community-based waiver programs:

| Program | Purpose | Who It Serves |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **CHOICES** | Long-term services and supports | Elderly and adults with physical disabilities |
| **ECF** (Employment and Community First) | Community integration and employment | Adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities |
| **Katie Beckett** | Home care for children | Children with disabilities who would otherwise require institutional care |

### Special Needs Planning
- Third-party SNTs protect TennCare eligibility
- First-party SNTs require TennCare payback at death
- ABLE TN accounts available (www.abletn.gov)
- Pooled trust options for beneficiaries 65+

### ABLE TN Accounts
ABLE accounts allow individuals with disabilities to save up to $100,000+ without affecting SSI/TennCare.

**Current eligibility (2025):**
- Disability onset before age 26
- Annual contribution limit: $18,000 (2024 limit, adjusts annually)
- Account limit: $100,000 for SSI eligibility

**⭐ SECURE Act 2.0 Change (Effective January 1, 2026):**
- Disability onset age **increases from 26 to 46**
- Significantly expands ABLE eligibility
- Many adults who became disabled in their 20s-40s will newly qualify

**ABLE Planning Integration:**
- ABLE can complement SNT (allows beneficiary more control)
- ABLE can receive rollovers from 529 plans
- First-party ABLE has Medicaid payback; third-party funding does not

### Asset Recovery
- TennCare may seek recovery from estates
- Applies to properly transferred probate estates
- Proper SNT planning can avoid recovery
- Homestead may be subject to recovery after both spouses deceased

## Property Titling for Tennessee Residents

### Tenancy by the Entirety (TBE)
**Recommended for married couples' assets:**
- Available for both real and personal property
- Strongest creditor protection in Tennessee
- Automatic survivorship
- Cannot be severed unilaterally

**How to Title for TBE:**
- Real property: "[Spouse 1] and [Spouse 2], husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety"
- Financial accounts: Both spouses named with TBE designation

### Trust Funding for Real Estate
When funding real estate into revocable trust:
1. **Quitclaim deed** or **warranty deed** to trust
2. Record with county register of deeds
3. No transfer tax for trust funding (exempt)
4. Update homeowners insurance with trust as named insured
5. Notify mortgage company (due-on-sale rarely enforced for revocable trusts)

### Mortgage Considerations
- Tennessee is a **title theory** state
- Deed of trust used (not mortgage)
- Trust funding generally doesn't trigger due-on-sale clause (per Garn-St. Germain Act)

## TBE vs Trust Transfer Decision

Tennessee married couples with TBE-titled homes face a significant decision when creating a revocable trust: whether to transfer the home into the trust.

### The Tradeoff

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║               TBE HOME: KEEP vs TRANSFER TO TRUST                ║

║                                                                  ║
║  KEEP IN TBE:                     TRANSFER TO TRUST:             ║

║  ✅ Survivorship (1st death)      ✅ Probate avoidance (both)    ║
║  ❌ No incapacity planning        ✅ Distribution control        ║

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Keep TBE | Transfer to Trust | Hybrid Approach |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **High liability profession** | ✅ Strong choice | ❌ Avoid | ✅ Good |
| **Blended family** | ❌ Risky | ✅ Recommended | ⚠️ Depends |
| **High appreciation + CPT** | ⚠️ Loses step-up | ✅ Best | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Simple estate, low liability** | Either works | Either works | Not needed |

### Recommendation Logic

**1. High Liability + Not Blended → Keep TBE**
- Creditor protection is paramount for doctors, attorneys, business owners
- TBE shields home from individual creditors
- Use pour-over will or TOD deed for second death planning
- Can still have trust for other assets

**2. Blended Family → Transfer to Trust**
- TBE survivorship can accidentally disinherit children from prior marriage
- When first spouse dies, survivor owns 100% outright
- Survivor can leave home to anyone—excluding first-to-die's children
- Trust with life estate provisions protects everyone's interests

**3. CPT Elected + High Appreciation + Low Liability → Transfer to CPT Trust**
- Double step-up in basis can save substantial capital gains tax
- Creditor protection less critical if low-risk profession
- If $400K+ appreciation, tax savings may justify transfer

**4. Otherwise → Discuss with Attorney**
- Multiple valid approaches for each situation
- Personal priorities determine best choice
- Attorney can evaluate specific circumstances

### Hybrid Strategies

**TBE + Pour-Over Will:**
```
During Both Lives:    Home in TBE (creditor protection)
At First Death:       Survivor owns outright (TBE survivorship)
Survivor Then:        Either funds to trust OR records TOD deed
At Second Death:      Home passes per trust/TOD
```
- Best of both: creditor protection during life + probate avoidance at death

**TBE for Home + CPT for Investments:**
```
Home:        Keep in TBE (maximum creditor protection)
Investments: Transfer to CPT trust (get double step-up)
Result:      Protected home + tax-efficient investments
```
- Ideal for high-liability professions with appreciated portfolios

**Life Estate + Remainder:**
```
Trust provides:       Surviving spouse lives in home for life
At Survivor's Death:  Home to first-to-die's children (or shared)
Protection:           Neither spouse can sell/mortgage unilaterally
```
- Protects blended family children while honoring survivor's housing

### Attorney Review Triggers

Flag for attorney review when:

| Situation | Concern |
|-----------|---------|
| High liability profession + chooses transfer | Verify understands loss of TBE protection |
| Blended family + chooses keep TBE | Risk of disinheriting children needs discussion |
| CPT elected but keeping home out of trust | May lose step-up benefit on largest asset |
| Pending claims or litigation mentioned | Timing of transfer is critical |
| Federal debt concerns | TBE does NOT protect from IRS liens |

### Important Notes

**TBE Protection Limits:**
- Only protects from ONE spouse's individual creditors
- Does NOT protect from:
  - Joint debts (co-signed by both)
  - Federal tax liens (IRS)
  - Debts where both spouses are liable
- Protection ends at divorce (converts to tenancy in common)

**CPT + TBE Are Mutually Exclusive:**
- Community property trust requires trust funding
- TBE requires property to remain in spouses' names
- For any given asset, must choose one or the other
- Hybrid approach: TBE for home, CPT for other appreciated assets

## Common Pitfalls

### For All Tennessee Residents
1. **Assuming old inheritance tax rules** - Fully repealed by 2016
2. **Not utilizing community property trust** - Unique TN advantage for step-up in basis
3. **Missing homestead designation** - Must be claimed in writing; protects $35,000/$52,500
4. **Springing POA difficulties** - Immediate effectiveness recommended
5. **Healthcare advance directive confusion** - Either witnesses OR notary (not both required)
6. **Dynasty trust opportunities missed** - 360-year trust duration available

### For Special Needs Planning
7. **Confusing DAPT and TennCare lookbacks** - DAPT is 18 months; TennCare is 5 years
8. **Not funding real estate into trust** - Assets must be titled in trust name to avoid probate
9. **Wrong SNT type** - Third-party SNT (no payback) vs. first-party SNT (payback required)
10. **Missing Letter of Intent** - Critical companion document for SNT trustees
11. **Not coordinating with ABLE account** - ABLE TN can complement SNT planning
12. **Ignoring TennCare waiver programs** - CHOICES and ECF provide valuable services

## Transfer on Death Instruments

### TOD Deed ⭐ NEW (Effective July 1, 2025)

Tennessee enacted TOD deed legislation (SB0984/HB1088) allowing beneficiary deeds for real estate.

**What is a TOD Deed?**
- Records transfer intent but owner retains full ownership during lifetime
- Property passes directly to beneficiaries at death without probate
- Owner can sell, mortgage, or change beneficiaries at any time
- Simpler and cheaper than trust for single-property situations

**When to Use TOD Deed vs. Trust:**

| Situation | TOD Deed | Revocable Trust |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Single property, simple plan | ✅ Preferred | Works but overkill |
| Multiple properties | Requires separate deed for each | ✅ Single document covers all |
| Multi-state property | Each state has different requirements | ✅ Single trust, multiple states |
| Incapacity planning | ❌ No incapacity protection | ✅ Seamless trustee succession |
| Privacy concerns | ❌ Recorded publicly | ✅ Trust is private |
| Complex distribution | ❌ Limited flexibility | ✅ Detailed provisions |

**TOD Deed Requirements (Tennessee):**
- Must be recorded during owner's lifetime
- Must be signed, acknowledged (notarized), and include legal description
- Beneficiary need not sign
- Revocable at any time by recording revocation or new deed

**Planning Note:** For clients with only Tennessee real estate seeking probate avoidance, TOD deed may be simpler than a trust. For comprehensive estate planning, trust remains preferred.

### TOD Securities
- Standard TOD registration available
- Bank POD accounts allowed
- Vehicles can have TOD beneficiary

## Witness Requirements

Witnesses for will must:
- Be 18+ years old
- Be competent
- Sign in presence of testator
- Disinterested strongly recommended (interested witnesses forfeit bequests exceeding intestate share per T.C.A. 32-1-103)

Witnesses for POA:
- No witnesses legally required
- Notarization recommended for third-party acceptance

Witnesses for advance care plan (if not notarized):
- Must be 18+
- Two required
- Not related by blood or marriage
- Not beneficiary
- Not responsible for healthcare costs
