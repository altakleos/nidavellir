## Power of Attorney

### Key Requirements

- Agent cannot be a witness
- Durable by default unless otherwise stated

- Designating beneficiaries
- Delegating authority

## Healthcare Documents

### Patient Advocate Designation
Michigan uses unique terminology:
- Healthcare agent called "patient advocate"
- Two witnesses required
- Notarization NOT required
- Specific statutory requirements

### Advocate Acceptance

### Living Will (Non-Statutory)
- Michigan has no living will statute

- Can create separate document but not legally mandated

## Probate

### Supervised Administration
- Court approval for all transactions
- Provides more protection
- More time-consuming

### Independent (Unsupervised) Administration
- Michigan allows unsupervised
- Must be authorized in will or by interested persons
- Less court involvement

### Small Estate Procedures

#### Administration by Publication
- Estates under $15,000 (after secured debts)
- Simplified procedure

#### Petition to Set Aside

## Special Considerations

### Michigan Trust Code

- Trust protector provisions
- Decanting allowed
- Directed trustee provisions

### Lady Bird Deed (Enhanced Life Estate)
- Michigan recognizes enhanced life estate deeds
- Grantor retains right to sell, mortgage, revoke
- Avoids probate while preserving Medicaid eligibility
- Also called "enhanced life estate deed"

### Tenancy by the Entirety
- Available for married couples (real property)
- Creditor protection for judgment creditors
- Automatic right of survivorship

### Homestead Exemption

- Up to 18 mills (varies by location)
- Must file affidavit with assessor

### Medicaid Planning
- 5-year lookback period
- Michigan specific income/asset limits
- Estate recovery from probate estate

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Patient advocate terminology** - Michigan doesn't use "healthcare proxy"
2. **Witness restrictions for patient advocate** - Very broad family exclusion
3. **POA requires both witnesses AND notary** - Missing either invalidates
4. **No statutory living will** - Must include wishes in patient advocate form
5. **Lady Bird deed specifics** - Must use correct language

## Transfer on Death Instruments
