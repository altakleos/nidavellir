# Common Law Property States - Estate Planning Considerations

## Overview

Common law property (also called "separate property" or "title-based property") is the default marital property system in 41 states and the District of Columbia. Under this system, property belongs to whoever holds title to it, regardless of marital status.

## Common Law States (41 States + DC)

All states except the 9 community property states:

| Region | States |
|--------|--------|
| **Northeast** | Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont |
| **Southeast** | Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia |
| **Midwest** | Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota |
| **Mountain** | Colorado, Montana, Utah, Wyoming |
| **Other** | Alaska*, Arkansas, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Oregon, District of Columbia |

*Alaska has opt-in community property trust

## Key Principles

### Title Determines Ownership

In common law states:
- Property belongs to whoever holds title
- Name on deed/account = owner
- Income belongs to earner
- Gifts belong to recipient

### Forms of Joint Ownership

| Form | Survivorship | Equal Shares | Creditor Protection |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Tenancy in Common** | No | Not required | None |
| **Joint Tenancy** | Yes | Required | None (in most states) |
| **Tenancy by Entirety** | Yes | Required | Yes (varies by state) |

### Tenancy by the Entirety

**Available for married couples only**:
- Both spouses own 100% (not 50/50)
- Cannot be severed unilaterally
- Creditor protection in many states
- Not available in all common law states

**States with TBE for real property only**:
Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Wyoming

**States with TBE for all property**:
Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Wyoming

## Estate Planning Implications

### Step-Up in Basis Rules

**Single Step-Up**: In common law states, only the decedent's share of jointly-held property receives a stepped-up basis.

**Example**:
- Couple owns stock as joint tenants
- Purchased for $100,000
- At first death, worth $500,000
- Only decedent's half ($250,000) steps up
- Survivor's basis: $50,000 + $250,000 = $300,000
- If sold: $200,000 taxable gain

**Compare to Community Property**:
- In CP state, full $500,000 steps up
- No capital gain if sold immediately

### Elective Share Protection

Common law states protect surviving spouses through **elective share** statutes:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Traditional** | Fixed percentage of probate estate (typically 1/3) |
| **Augmented** | Percentage of augmented estate (includes nonprobate assets) |
| **UPC Model** | Based on length of marriage (2% per year, max 50%) |

**Typical Elective Share Ranges**:
- 1/3 of estate (traditional states)
- 30-50% depending on circumstances
- Some states: greater of $ amount or percentage

### Estate Inclusion Issues

**Joint Tenancy Tax Trap**:
- IRC §2040(a): Full value included in decedent's estate UNLESS survivor can prove contribution
- Common with parent-child joint accounts
- Creates potential double taxation

**Exceptions**:
- Spousal joint property: 50% automatically included
- Survivor can prove contribution: proportionate inclusion

## Planning Strategies

### Choosing Form of Ownership

**Tenancy in Common**:
- Best for: Estate tax planning, unequal contributions
- Allows different percentages
- No automatic survivorship
- Each tenant can will their share

**Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship**:
- Best for: Simple probate avoidance
- Equal ownership required
- Automatic transfer at death
- Creditor issues (both tenants' creditors can reach)

**Tenancy by the Entirety** (if available):
- Best for: Asset protection, married couples
- Strongest creditor protection
- Neither spouse can unilaterally sever
- Check state law for availability

### Maximizing Basis Step-Up

**Problem**: Joint property only gets single step-up

**Solutions**:
1. **Community Property Trust** (in opt-in states)
   - Convert to CP character
   - Get double step-up benefit

2. **Separate ownership of appreciated assets**
   - Give appreciated assets to spouse with shorter life expectancy
   - Full step-up at their death

3. **Use of trusts**
   - Hold appreciated assets in revocable trust
   - Plan for optimal basis step-up

### Protecting Against Elective Share

If disinheriting spouse is intended (rare but legal reasons exist):
- Understand state's augmented estate concept
- Review what assets are included
- Prenuptial/postnuptial agreements
- Some assets may be excluded

## State-Specific Variations

### Florida

- Strong homestead protection
- Unique descent restrictions on homestead
- Elective share includes revocable trust assets (30%)
- Tenancy by entirety for all property

### New York

- Elective share: greater of $50,000 or 1/3
- Includes augmented estate
- Strict will execution requirements
- Estate tax cliff consideration

### Pennsylvania

- Inheritance tax (not estate tax)
- 4.5% to children, 12% to siblings, 15% to others
- 0% to spouse
- Real estate transfer tax on trust funding

### Massachusetts

- Estate tax with $2M exemption
- Tenancy by entirety available (real property)
- Elective share varies by circumstances

## Common Planning Mistakes

1. **Assuming joint ownership solves everything**
   - May create unintended gift
   - Exposes assets to both parties' creditors
   - May defeat estate plan (survivorship trumps will)

2. **Not understanding basis step-up limitations**
   - Only decedent's share steps up
   - Can result in significant capital gains

3. **Ignoring elective share planning**
   - Spouse can often reach nonprobate assets
   - Prenuptial agreements may be needed

4. **Creating joint tenancy with children**
   - Gift tax implications
   - Exposes asset to child's creditors/divorce
   - IRC §2040 inclusion issues

5. **Moving from community property state**
   - Property character may be preserved
   - Quasi-community property rules in some states

## Comparison: Community Property vs. Common Law

| Issue | Community Property | Common Law |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Default ownership | 50/50 community | Title holder |
| Basis step-up at death | Full (both halves) | Half (decedent's share only) |
| Spouse disinheritance | Can only will their half | Elective share protects spouse |
| Creditor reach | Varies by state | Title holder's creditors |
| Business interests | Spouse has community interest | Title holder owns unless gifted |
| Income earned | Community property | Earner's property |
