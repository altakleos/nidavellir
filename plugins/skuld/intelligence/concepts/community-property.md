# Community Property States - Estate Planning Considerations

## Overview

Community property is a marital property system derived from Spanish and French civil law traditions. In community property states, most property acquired during marriage is owned equally (50/50) by both spouses, regardless of whose name is on the title or who earned the income.

## Community Property States (9 States)

| State | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Arizona** | Standard community property |
| **California** | Community property; quasi-community property rules for out-of-state assets |
| **Idaho** | Standard community property |
| **Louisiana** | Civil law system; unique terminology ("community of acquets and gains") |
| **Nevada** | Standard community property; community property trust option |
| **New Mexico** | Standard community property |
| **Texas** | Community property; income from separate property is community |
| **Washington** | Community property; no quasi-community property rules |
| **Wisconsin** | Marital property system (based on Uniform Marital Property Act) |

### Opt-In States

Some common law states allow couples to create community property through trusts:
- **Alaska** (community property trust option)
- **Tennessee** (community property trust)
- **South Dakota** (community property trust)
- **Kentucky** (community property trust)
- **Florida** (community property trust, effective 2021)

## What Is Community Property?

### Generally Community Property
- Wages and earnings during marriage
- Income from community property
- Property purchased with community funds
- Business interests acquired during marriage
- Retirement benefits earned during marriage

### Generally Separate Property
- Property owned before marriage
- Gifts received by one spouse (during marriage)
- Inheritances received by one spouse
- Property acquired after permanent separation
- Personal injury awards (except lost wages component)

## Estate Planning Implications

### Double Step-Up in Basis

**Key Tax Advantage**: When one spouse dies, BOTH halves of community property receive a stepped-up basis to fair market value.

**Example**:
- Couple purchased stock for $100,000 (community property)
- At first spouse's death, stock worth $500,000
- Both halves step up: survivor's basis becomes $500,000
- If sold immediately: $0 capital gain

**Compare to Common Law States**:
- Joint tenancy: Only decedent's half steps up
- If same stock in common law state, survivor's basis would be $300,000
- Potential $200,000 taxable gain

### Character Tracing

Community property states require careful documentation:
- Separate property must be traced to remain separate
- Commingling can convert separate property to community
- Prenuptial agreements can clarify character
- Transmutation agreements can change character

### Each Spouse Controls Their Half

In community property states:
- Each spouse can will their 50% to anyone
- No "elective share" concept for community property
- Separate property rules vary by state
- Surviving spouse cannot be completely disinherited from community property

## State-Specific Variations

### California
- **Quasi-Community Property**: Property acquired while domiciled elsewhere that would have been CP if acquired in California
- At death: QCP treated as CP
- At divorce: QCP treated as CP
- **Inception of title rule**: Character determined when acquired

### Texas
- **Income from separate property is community**
- Unique among CP states
- Complicates estate planning for separate property owners
- Partition agreements commonly used

### Louisiana
- **Civil law system** (not common law)
- Different terminology ("community of acquets and gains")
- Forced heirship rules
- Complex succession laws
- **CRITICAL**: Estate planning documents must follow Louisiana requirements

### Wisconsin
- Called "marital property" not community property
- Based on Uniform Marital Property Act
- Substantially similar to CP states
- Some unique provisions

### Nevada
- Community property with right of survivorship option
- Community Property Trust available
- Favorable trust laws

## Planning Strategies

### Agreements Between Spouses

1. **Prenuptial Agreement**
   - Define separate property
   - Agree on treatment of future acquisitions
   - Waive certain rights

2. **Postnuptial Agreement**
   - Convert community to separate (or vice versa)
   - Partition community property
   - Must be in writing

3. **Transmutation Agreement**
   - Change character of specific property
   - Can be formal or informal (depends on state)

### Trust Planning in CP States

**Revocable Trust Considerations**:
- Funding with CP maintains character
- Both spouses should be grantors/trustees
- Preserve double step-up benefit
- Document separate property contributed

**Community Property Trust** (in opt-in states):
- Married couples in common law states
- Can elect CP treatment for trust assets
- Gain double step-up benefit
- Must meet state requirements

### Retirement Accounts

**ERISA-governed plans** (401(k), pension):
- Spouse must consent to non-spouse beneficiary
- Community property interest exists even if titled in one name
- Spousal consent required for loans/withdrawals in some cases

**IRAs**:
- State law determines community property character
- Beneficiary designation still controls at death
- But surviving spouse has CP interest

## Common Planning Mistakes

1. **Ignoring character of property**
   - Assuming all marital property is community
   - Failing to trace separate property

2. **Commingling separate property**
   - Depositing inheritance in joint account
   - Using separate funds for community expenses without documentation

3. **Moving between states**
   - Not addressing property character when moving
   - Assuming common law rules apply to property acquired in CP state

4. **Business interests**
   - Failing to address spouse's community interest in business
   - Not documenting separate property contributions

5. **Estate plan silent on character**
   - Assuming documents work for all property
   - Not specifically addressing CP vs. separate property
