# Document Priority Matrix: What You Need Based on Your Life Stage

## Overview

Not everyone needs every estate planning document. This matrix helps prioritize which documents matter most for your specific situation.

---

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Complete as soon as possible; significant risk without it |
| **HIGH** | Complete within 3 months; important protection |
| **MODERATE** | Complete within 6 months; valuable but not urgent |
| **OPTIONAL** | Consider based on specific circumstances |

## By Life Stage

### Young Adult (18-30), Single, No Children

| Document | Priority | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Healthcare Directive | **CRITICAL** | Parents have NO automatic authority once you're 18 |
| Financial POA | **HIGH** | Someone must handle affairs if you're incapacitated |
| Simple Will | MODERATE | Prevents intestate distribution |
| Trust | OPTIONAL | Usually not needed unless significant assets |

**Minimum package:** Healthcare Directive + Financial POA

**Key insight:** At 18, your parents legally cannot make medical decisions for you or access your finances without proper documents.

---

### Young Couple, No Children, Unmarried

| Document | Priority | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Healthcare Directive | **CRITICAL** | Partner has NO legal authority without it |
| Financial POA | **CRITICAL** | Partner cannot access your accounts |
| Will | **HIGH** | Partner inherits NOTHING under intestate law |
| Trust | MODERATE | Helpful if you own property together |

**Minimum package:** Healthcare Directive + Financial POA + Will

**Parents' truth:** Will naming a guardian is non-negotiable if you have minor children.

**Asset owners' truth:** Trust is strongly recommended if you own real estate.
