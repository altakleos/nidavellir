### Asset Treatment

**Joint Trust:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Joint Trust                 │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │   All Marital Assets        │   │
│  │   - House                   │   │
│  │   - Bank accounts           │   │
│  │   - Investments             │   │
│  │   - Everything together     │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Separate Trusts:**
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│  Spouse A Trust │    │  Spouse B Trust │
│  ┌───────────┐  │    │  ┌───────────┐  │

### First Marriage vs. Blended Family

**First Marriage (Both Spouses' First):**

| Consideration | Joint | Separate |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Simplicity | **Winner** | More complex |
| Cost | **Lower** | Higher (2 docs) |
| Flexibility at first death | Less | More |
| Children's inheritance | Same kids | Same kids |
| Recommendation | **Preferred** | Rarely needed |

**Blended Family (Prior Children Exist):**

| Consideration | Joint | Separate |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Protect children from prior marriage | Difficult | **Much easier** |
| Prevent disinheritance by surviving spouse | Risky | **Protected** |
| "All to spouse, then to kids" problem | **High risk** | Avoided |
| Recommendation | Use with caution | **Preferred** |

---

### The "All to Spouse" Problem (Blended Families)

**Scenario:** John (kids from first marriage) marries Sarah (kids from first marriage). Joint trust leaves everything to surviving spouse.

**Risk with Joint Trust:**
1. John dies first
2. Sarah inherits everything
3. Sarah changes her trust to leave everything to HER children
4. John's children get nothing

**Solution with Separate Trusts:**
- John's trust: At death, his share goes to his children (or trust for their benefit)
- Sarah receives income/use but doesn't control principal
- John's children protected regardless of what Sarah does later

---

### QTIP Provisions (Blended Family Protection)

**QTIP = Qualified Terminable Interest Property**

Can be added to either joint or separate trusts, but more commonly used with separate trusts.

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| At first death | Surviving spouse gets income for life |
| Principal access | Limited or none |
| At second death | Goes to deceased spouse's chosen beneficiaries |
| Control | Deceased spouse controls ultimate distribution |

**Example QTIP Language:**
> "Upon my death, my spouse shall receive all income from my trust for life. Upon my spouse's death, the remaining principal shall be distributed to my children from my prior marriage."

### Community Property State Considerations

**Community Property States:** AZ, CA, ID, LA, NV, NM, TX, WA, WI

| Factor | Joint Trust | Separate Trusts |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Preserves CP character | **Yes** | Requires careful drafting |
| Double step-up in basis | **Automatic** | Must be structured correctly |
| Separate property tracking | Combined (harder) | **Easier** |

**Important:** In community property states, a joint trust often makes sense to:
- Preserve community property character
- Get double step-up in basis at first death
- Simplify administration

---

### Common Law State Considerations

**Common Law States:** All states except the 9 community property states

| Factor | Joint Trust | Separate Trusts |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Asset ownership | Must be titled correctly | Clearer separation |
| Creditor protection | None for either | Slightly better |
| Divorce implications | Commingled = harder | Clearer divisions |

---

### High Net Worth Considerations

For estates over federal estate tax exemption ($13.99M individual, $27.98M married in 2025):

| Strategy | Joint Trust | Separate Trusts |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| A-B Trust structure | Can include | **Easier to implement** |
| Portability election | Available | Available |
| Flexibility | Less | **More** |
| GST planning | Possible | **Easier** |

**Note:** For estates this large, consult with estate planning attorney. Skuld can help with basic structure, but tax optimization requires professional guidance.

---

### Administrative Comparison

| Task | Joint Trust | Separate Trusts |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Initial setup | **Simpler** | Two documents |
| Annual maintenance | **One trust** | Two trusts |
| Asset re-titling | To one trust | Split between two |
| After first death | Trust continues | One trust administers/distributes |
| Record keeping | **Combined** | Must track separately |

---

### Cost Comparison

| Item | Joint Trust | Separate Trusts |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Attorney fees (creation) | $1,500-3,000 | $2,500-5,000 |
| Funding complexity | **Lower** | Higher |
| Amendment costs | **One document** | Two documents |
| Administration at first death | **Simpler** | More complex |

## What Both Spouses Need Regardless

Whether you choose joint or separate trusts, each spouse still needs:
- **Pour-over will** (names guardian for minor children)
- **Durable Power of Attorney** (for non-trust assets)
- **Healthcare Directive** (medical decisions)

These are individual documents even with a joint trust.
