## Overview

This document explains what happens when someone dies or becomes incapacitated WITHOUT proper estate planning documents. Understanding these consequences helps users appreciate why planning matters.

## Without a Will (Intestate Succession)

### What Happens

When you die without a valid will, state law determines who inherits your assets through "intestate succession" rules.

### Typical Intestate Distribution (varies by state)

| Family Situation | Who Inherits |
|------------------|--------------|
| Married, no children | Spouse gets all (most states) or spouse + parents |
| Married with children | Spouse gets 1/3 to 1/2, children split remainder |
| Unmarried with children | Children split equally |
| No spouse or children | Parents, then siblings, then extended family |
| Unmarried partner | **Nothing** (not recognized) |

### Problems with Intestate Succession

**1. Spouse may not get everything**
> In many states, your spouse must share with your children or parents. If your children are minors, their inheritance goes into a court-supervised account.

**2. Unmarried partners get nothing**
> Your partner of 20 years has NO inheritance rights under intestate law. Everything goes to your legal relatives.

**3. Stepchildren excluded**
> Stepchildren you raised as your own have NO inheritance rights unless legally adopted.

**4. No control over who gets what**
> Can't leave heirlooms to specific people, disinherit estranged relatives, or make charitable gifts.

**5. Court appoints administrator**
> A judge chooses who manages your estate - may not be who you'd choose.

### Real-World Example

*Tom dies without a will. He has a wife (Sarah) and two minor children. In their state:*
- Sarah receives 1/3 of estate outright
- Children receive 2/3 in court-supervised accounts
- Sarah cannot access kids' money without court approval
- Every financial decision requires court hearings
- Legal fees: $5,000-20,000 additional

**If Tom had a will:** Sarah could have inherited everything, managed money for kids freely.

## Without a Trust (Probate Required)

### What Happens

Assets pass through probate - a court-supervised process to validate your will and transfer assets.

### Probate Realities

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Timeline | 6-18 months (simple); 2+ years (contested) |
| Cost | 3-7% of estate value |
| Privacy | **Everything becomes public record** |
| Control | Court supervises all transactions |
| Geographic | Separate probate in each state where you own property |

### Probate Costs by Estate Size

| Estate Value | Estimated Probate Cost |
|--------------|----------------------|
| $100,000 | $3,000-7,000 |
| $250,000 | $7,500-17,500 |
| $500,000 | $15,000-35,000 |
| $1,000,000 | $30,000-70,000 |

*Costs include attorney fees, executor fees, court fees, appraisals, and accounting.*

### Real-World Example

*Maria owns a $400,000 home and $150,000 in accounts. She has a will but no trust.*

**Probate result:**
- 9-month timeline before heirs receive anything
- $18,000 in probate costs
- Full inventory filed publicly (anyone can see what she owned)
- Heirs frustrated by delays and fees

**If Maria had a trust:** Assets could have transferred within weeks, privately, with minimal legal fees (~$1,500).

## Without a Power of Attorney (Financial)

### What Happens

If you become incapacitated without a financial POA, no one has authority to manage your finances. A court must appoint a conservator/guardian.

### Conservatorship Process

| Step | Timeline | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| File petition | Week 1 | $500-1,500 |
| Court hearing | 4-8 weeks | Attorney fees ongoing |
| Investigation | 2-4 weeks | Investigator fees |
| Appointment | Week 8-12 | Bond premiums begin |
| Ongoing oversight | Indefinite | Annual accountings, court fees |

**Total first-year cost:** $5,000-15,000+
**Annual ongoing cost:** $2,000-5,000+

### Conservatorship Restrictions

Even after appointment, the conservator:
- Must get court approval for major transactions
- Cannot make gifts (even normal birthday/holiday gifts)
- Must file detailed annual accountings
- Cannot access assets for family needs without hearings
- May be someone you wouldn't have chosen

### Real-World Example

*Robert, 68, has a stroke and cannot manage his affairs. He has no POA.*

**What happens:**
- Wife cannot access his bank accounts or investment accounts
- Cannot pay his share of the mortgage from his accounts
- Must petition court for conservatorship
- Process takes 3 months; family scrambles for cash
- Court appoints wife as conservator - but with full court oversight
- Every financial decision requires court approval or annual justification
- Total cost over 3 years of incapacity: $25,000+

**If Robert had a POA:** Wife would immediately step in as agent, manage all finances, no court involvement, no cost.

## Without a Healthcare Directive

### What Happens

If you cannot communicate healthcare wishes and have no directive:
- Doctors must use default treatments (often aggressive life support)
- Family may disagree about what you'd want
- Court may need to appoint healthcare decision-maker
- End-of-life can become prolonged and traumatic

### Without Healthcare Proxy

**Who decides?** State law provides a hierarchy (typically: spouse, adult children, parents, siblings), but:
- Multiple people may have equal authority
- Disagreements can paralyze decisions
- Hospital may require court order to resolve conflicts

### Without Living Will

**What happens?** Doctors provide all life-sustaining treatment by default:
- Mechanical ventilation continues indefinitely
- Feeding tubes inserted automatically
- CPR attempted regardless of prognosis
- Prolonged ICU stays are common

### Real-World Example

*Susan, 72, has a major stroke. She's on life support with no realistic recovery. No healthcare directive.*

**What happens:**
- Her three adult children disagree: one wants "everything done," two want comfort care
- Hospital won't remove life support without consensus or court order
- Family files for guardianship to resolve dispute
- 6 weeks of family conflict, $8,000 in legal fees
- Susan remains on life support for 4 months before passing
- Family relationships permanently damaged

**If Susan had a healthcare directive:** Her wishes would be clear. Proxy could authorize comfort care immediately. Family united in honoring her wishes.

## Without Guardian Designation (Minor Children)

### What Happens

If both parents die without naming a guardian, a court chooses who raises your children.

### Court Process

1. **Emergency placement** - Children go to nearest willing relative or foster care
2. **Petition filed** - Multiple relatives may petition for guardianship
3. **Investigation** - Court investigator interviews relatives, children
4. **Hearing** - Judge decides based on "best interests"
5. **Ongoing oversight** - Guardian must report to court

### Problems with Court-Appointed Guardians

- May not be who you'd choose
- Family members may fight over custody
- Children's wishes may be ignored (especially for young children)
- Process traumatic for grieving children
- Can take 4-6 months to resolve
- Legal costs: $5,000-20,000+ if contested

### Real-World Example

*Mike and Lisa die in car accident. Two children ages 6 and 9. No will naming guardian.*

**What happens:**
- Children initially placed with Lisa's sister (nearest relative)
- Mike's parents petition for guardianship
- Lisa's mother also petitions
- Contentious court battle ensues
- Children interviewed by court investigator
- 8 months of uncertainty for grieving children
- Judge ultimately chooses Mike's parents (closer geographically)
- Lisa's family resentful; family divided
- Total legal costs: $35,000

**If Mike and Lisa had wills:** Guardian named clearly. Mike's parents appointed without contest. Children transition quickly. Family united.

**New York (Common Law):**
- Spouse gets $50,000 + 1/2 of remainder if children exist
- Children split the other half

**Texas (Community Property):**

## Action Steps

### Minimum Documents Everyone Needs

1. **Will** - Names guardian for minor children, distributes assets not in trust
2. **Durable Power of Attorney** - Financial management during incapacity
3. **Healthcare Directive** - Living will + healthcare proxy

### Recommended for Most People

4. **Revocable Living Trust** - Avoids probate, provides incapacity protection

### Special Situations

5. **Special Needs Trust** - If you have disabled beneficiaries
6. **QTIP Trust Provisions** - Blended families

---

## Bottom Line

**Estate planning is not about death - it's about protecting the people you love.**

Without planning:
- Courts decide who raises your children
- State law divides your property (maybe not as you'd wish)
- Lawyers and courts consume significant assets
- Family may be torn apart by conflict
- Your final years may be prolonged and traumatic

With planning:
- You choose who cares for your children
- Your property goes where you want
- Transfer costs are minimal
- Family is united by your clear wishes
- Your end-of-life reflects your values

**The cost of planning: $2,000-5,000 once**
**The cost of not planning: $50,000-100,000+ and immeasurable emotional harm**
