# Distribution Strategy: Decision Support Matrix

## Quick Answer

| If you... | Recommended |
|-----------|-------------|
| Have young children (under 25) | **Staggered** - protects from immaturity |
| Have financially responsible adult children | **All at once at 25** - simpler administration |
| Worry about spendthrift habits | **Staggered later (30/35/40)** - extended protection |
| Have children with different needs | **Unequal shares** - customize per child |
| Want grandchildren protected if child dies | **Per stirpes** - share stays in branch |
| Want surviving children to inherit more | **Per capita** - share goes to survivors |

## Age-Based Distribution Options

### Why Not Distribute Everything at 18?

**At age 18, most beneficiaries:**
- Lack financial management experience
- May be influenced by peers or predatory relationships
- Haven't completed education
- Don't understand long-term consequences of financial decisions

**Common problems with age-18 distributions:**
- Immediate large purchases (cars, vacations)
- Lending money to friends/partners
- Vulnerability to scams and predatory lending
- Dropping out of college ("I don't need to work")
- Relationship exploitation ("inheritance hunters")

**Statistics suggest:**
- 70% of inherited wealth is lost by the second generation
- The younger the recipient, the faster wealth dissipates
- Staggered distributions correlate with better wealth preservation

### Distribution Age Comparison

| Schedule | First Distribution | Second Distribution | Final Distribution | Best For |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| **Standard Staggered** | 1/3 at 25 | 1/3 at 30 | Remainder at 35 | Most families (recommended) |
| **Earlier Staggered** | 1/3 at 21 | 1/3 at 25 | Remainder at 30 | Financially mature young adults |
| **Later Staggered** | 1/3 at 30 | 1/3 at 35 | Remainder at 40 | Spendthrift concerns, large estates |
| **All at Once at 25** | 100% at 25 | - | - | Simple estates, responsible beneficiaries |

## Equal vs. Unequal Distribution

### When Equal Shares Make Sense

| Situation | Why Equal Works |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Children are similar ages | Similar life stages, similar needs |
| No special circumstances | Simplicity reduces conflict |
| Family harmony is priority | Perception of fairness |
| You don't want to explain choices | Less risk of disputes |

### When Unequal Shares Make Sense

| Situation | Why Unequal May Be Appropriate |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Special needs child | May need lifetime support |
| Blended family | Different relationships with different children |
| Child already received lifetime gifts | Equalizing across lifetime giving |
| One child is caregiver | Compensation for care provided |
| Significant income disparity | Child with less income needs more |
| Child in high-risk situation | Protecting from creditors or bad decisions |

**Important:** If choosing unequal distribution, consider:
- Including a brief explanation in the trust ("This unequal distribution reflects...")
- Discussing with children before death to prevent disputes
- Attorney review to ensure enforceability

## Per Stirpes vs. Per Capita

### Visual Explanation

```
SCENARIO: You have 3 children. Child A dies before you, leaving 2 grandchildren.

                        YOU
                         │
           ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
           │             │             │
        Child A       Child B       Child C
        (deceased)
           │
     ┌─────┴─────┐
     │           │
Grandchild 1  Grandchild 2


PER STIRPES ("by the branch"):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Child B:        1/3 (33.3%)                             │
│ Child C:        1/3 (33.3%)                             │
│ Grandchild 1:   1/6 (16.7%) ─┐                          │
│ Grandchild 2:   1/6 (16.7%) ─┴─ Child A's share splits  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Share stays in the "branch" of the family tree.


PER CAPITA ("by the head"):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Child B:        1/2 (50%)                               │
│ Child C:        1/2 (50%)                               │
│ Grandchild 1:   0                                       │
│ Grandchild 2:   0                                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Only surviving beneficiaries inherit. Grandchildren excluded.
```

### When to Choose Per Stirpes

**Per stirpes is recommended when:**
- You want inheritance to stay in each "branch" of the family
- Fairness between branches matters more than individual count
- You have or may have grandchildren
- You want grandchildren to inherit their parent's share

**Per stirpes is chosen by ~85% of families.**

### When to Choose Per Capita

**Per capita may be appropriate when:**
- You don't have grandchildren and don't expect to
- You want assets concentrated with surviving children
- Deceased child's children have other resources
- You specifically want to exclude representation

---

## Discretionary vs. Mandatory Distributions

### HEMS Standard (Health, Education, Maintenance, Support)

The HEMS standard gives trustees discretion to distribute for:
- **Health:** Medical care, insurance, dental, mental health
- **Education:** Tuition, books, training, professional development
- **Maintenance:** Reasonable living expenses appropriate to lifestyle
- **Support:** Housing, food, clothing, transportation

**Advantages:**
- Protects assets from beneficiary's creditors
- Allows trustee to adapt to changing circumstances
- Prevents beneficiary from demanding distributions
- Still provides objective, legally recognized standards

**Disadvantages:**
- Less certainty for beneficiary
- Potential for trustee conflict
- Requires responsible trustee selection

### When to Use Discretionary Distributions

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Minor children | **Discretionary** - trustee manages for their needs |
| Adult children, responsible | **Staggered mandatory** - receive at set ages |
| Adult children, spendthrift concerns | **Discretionary** - ongoing trustee protection |
| Special needs beneficiary | **Fully discretionary** - protect benefits eligibility |
| Blended family with QTIP | **Mandatory income, discretionary principal** |

---

## State-Specific Considerations

### Forced Heirship (Louisiana)

Louisiana law requires that certain heirs (forced heirs) receive a minimum portion:
- 1 forced heir: 25% of estate
- 2+ forced heirs: 50% of estate

**Impact:** You cannot fully disinherit forced heirs (children under 24 or disabled children of any age) in Louisiana.

### Community Property States

In CA, TX, AZ, NV, WA, ID, NM, WI, and LA:
- Each spouse owns 50% of community property
- Can only distribute your 50% share
- Affects blended family distribution planning

### Elective Share States

In many states, surviving spouses can claim an "elective share" (often 1/3) regardless of trust terms. This may affect distributions to children if surviving spouse exercises this right.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's a Problem | Solution |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Distributing everything at 18 | Beneficiary too young | Use staggered ages (25/30/35) |
| Not addressing predeceased beneficiaries | Ambiguity causes disputes | Specify per stirpes or per capita |
| Equal shares when unequal is needed | Doesn't address special circumstances | Consider each child's needs |
| No trustee discretion | Inflexible to changing circumstances | Include HEMS standard for interim distributions |
| Forgetting grandchildren | Share could lapse | Per stirpes ensures representation |
| Same distribution age for all children | Different children mature differently | Consider per-child customization |

---

## Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **At what age would I trust my children with a significant sum?**
   - If under 30, consider staggered distributions
   - If over 35, consider earlier distributions

2. **Do any of my children have special circumstances?**
   - Special needs → Special Needs Trust provisions
   - Creditor issues → Extended trustee discretion
   - Spendthrift habits → Later distribution ages

3. **What happens if one of my children dies before me?**
   - Want grandchildren to inherit? → Per stirpes
   - Want surviving children only? → Per capita

4. **Should all my children receive the same amount?**
   - Similar circumstances → Equal shares (simpler)
   - Different needs/relationships → Consider unequal

5. **Do I want the trustee to have ongoing discretion?**
   - Want beneficiary to have certainty → Mandatory distributions
   - Want flexibility for circumstances → HEMS discretionary standard

## Summary Recommendations

| Family Situation | Distribution Age | Equal/Unequal | Method |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| **Young children, simple family** | Staggered (25/30/35) | Equal | Per stirpes |
| **Adult children, responsible** | All at once at 25 | Equal | Per stirpes |
| **Blended family** | Staggered (25/30/35) | Consider unequal | Per stirpes |
| **Special needs child** | Discretionary/HEMS | Likely unequal | Per stirpes |
| **Spendthrift concerns** | Staggered later (30/35/40) | Equal | Per stirpes |
| **No grandchildren expected** | Any schedule | Equal | Either (per stirpes safer) |

**Default recommendation:** Staggered distributions (1/3 at 25, 1/3 at 30, remainder at 35), equal shares, per stirpes distribution. This works well for most families.
