## Quick Answer

| If you... | Recommended |
|-----------|-------------|
| Own real estate | **Trust** - avoids probate on property |
| Have minor children only | **Will** - still need for guardian naming |
| Want privacy | **Trust** - not public record |
| Have simple estate (<$100K) | **Will** - simpler, less expensive |
| Own property in multiple states | **Trust** - avoids multiple probates |
| Want immediate effect | **Trust** - works during incapacity |
| Have blended family | **Trust** - more control over distributions |

## Detailed Comparison

### Probate Avoidance

| Factor | Will | Revocable Trust |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Goes through probate? | **Yes** | **No** (if properly funded) |
| Public record? | **Yes** | **No** |
| Court supervision? | **Yes** | **No** |
| Timeline | 6-18 months | Immediate |

**Probate costs by state (approximate % of estate):**

| State | Probate Cost Range | Trust Advantage |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| California | 4-7% | HIGH |
| Florida | 3-5% | HIGH |
| New York | 2-5% | HIGH |
| Texas | 1-3% | MODERATE |
| Tennessee | 1-2% | MODERATE |
| Most states | 2-4% | MODERATE |

*Example: On a $500,000 estate in California, probate costs ~$25,000-35,000. A trust costs ~$1,500-3,000 to establish.*

### Privacy

| Document | Who Can See It | When |
|----------|----------------|------|
| Will | Anyone | After death (probate filing) |
| Trust | Beneficiaries only | When distributions occur |

**Why privacy matters:**
- Asset amounts stay private
- Family disputes less likely to attract attention
- Beneficiary identities protected
- Disinheritance decisions not public

---

### Incapacity Protection

| Scenario | Will | Trust |
|----------|------|-------|
| You become incapacitated | Does nothing | Successor trustee manages assets |
| Mental decline | Court-appointed conservator | Seamless transition |
| Temporary incapacity | Stuck | Trustee handles affairs |

**Critical insight:** A will only works at death. A trust works during your lifetime AND at death.

---

### Control Over Distributions

| Feature | Will | Trust |
|---------|------|-------|
| Age-based distributions | Limited | **Full control** |
| Spendthrift protection | No | **Yes** |
| Incentive provisions | No | **Yes** |
| Special needs provisions | Separate SNT needed | **Can include** |
| Remarriage protection | Limited | **QTIP provisions** |

**Example trust provisions:**
- "Distribute 1/3 at age 25, 1/3 at 30, remainder at 35"
- "Distributions only for health, education, maintenance, support"
- "No distributions if beneficiary has active substance abuse"

---

### Cost Comparison

| Item | Will | Trust |
|------|------|-------|
| Initial creation | $300-800 | $1,500-5,000 |
| Funding required? | No | **Yes** (critical) |
| Ongoing maintenance | None | Periodic review |
| Probate costs | **Yes** | **No** |
| Total 10-year cost (typical) | $5,000-25,000 | $2,000-6,000 |

**The math:** Trusts cost more upfront but save significant probate costs later.

---

### Complexity Comparison

| Task | Will | Trust |
|------|------|-------|
| Creation | Simple | Moderate |
| Funding | Not required | **Required** (often forgotten) |
| Updates | Codicil or new will | Amendment or restatement |
| Real estate changes | Re-title after death | Re-title during life |

**Common trust funding tasks:**
- Real estate: Deed to trust name
- Bank accounts: Re-title or new account
- Brokerage: Re-title to trust
- Retirement accounts: **Do NOT re-title** (beneficiary designation only)
- Life insurance: Change beneficiary (or owner for ILIT)

---

### When Will Is Sufficient

A will may be sufficient if ALL of the following apply:
- Total assets under $100,000 (or state's small estate threshold)
- No real estate OR only one property in one state
- No blended family complications
- Beneficiaries are responsible adults
- Privacy not a concern
- You have a durable POA for incapacity

### When Trust Is Recommended

A trust is strongly recommended if ANY of the following apply:
- Own real estate (especially in multiple states)
- Total assets over state's small estate threshold
- Want to avoid probate delays
- Privacy important
- Blended family situation
- Beneficiaries need protection (age, spending, creditors)
- Concerned about incapacity planning

---

## State-Specific Considerations

### Community Property States (AZ, CA, ID, LA, NV, NM, TX, WA, WI)
- Consider joint trust for married couples
- Community property gets double step-up in basis
- Trust can preserve community property character

### States with Low Probate Costs
- Texas, Tennessee: Probate relatively inexpensive
- Trust still valuable for privacy and control

### States with High Probate Costs
- California, Florida, New York: Trust strongly recommended
- Probate savings often exceed trust creation costs

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "A trust avoids estate taxes" | **False** - Revocable trusts don't reduce estate taxes |
| "I don't need a will if I have a trust" | **False** - Pour-over will catches unfunded assets |
| "Trusts are only for wealthy people" | **False** - Anyone with real estate benefits |
| "Once I create a trust, I'm done" | **False** - Must fund the trust with assets |
| "A trust protects assets from creditors" | **False** - Revocable trusts don't provide asset protection |

## Bottom Line

**Most people with real estate or assets over $100,000 benefit from a revocable living trust.** The upfront cost is offset by probate savings, and the added benefits of privacy, incapacity protection, and distribution control make trusts the preferred choice for comprehensive estate planning.

**However:** Even with a trust, you still need:
- Pour-over will (catches unfunded assets, names guardians)
- Durable Power of Attorney (for non-trust assets)
- Healthcare Directive (medical decisions)
