## What Are These Options?

### Transfer-on-Death (TOD) Deed
A deed that transfers property automatically at death, without probate, while you keep full ownership and control during life.

**Also known as:** Beneficiary deed, TOD deed, transfer-on-death instrument

### Trust Funding (Deed to Trust)
Transferring property ownership to your revocable living trust during your lifetime.

## Detailed Comparison

### Simplicity

| Factor | TOD Deed | Trust Funding |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Documents needed | 1 deed | Trust + deed to trust |
| Recording required | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Attorney needed? | Usually no | Recommended |
| Can DIY? | **Often yes** | More complex |
| Cost | $50-200 | $1,500-3,000+ (trust) |

### Control & Flexibility

| Factor | TOD Deed | Trust Funding |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Can sell property freely? | **Yes** | **Yes** (as trustee) |
| Can change beneficiary? | **Yes** (new deed) | **Yes** (trust amendment) |
| Can revoke? | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Incapacity protection? | **No** | **Yes** |
| Complex distribution terms? | **No** | **Yes** |

### Incapacity Scenario

**Critical difference:** A TOD deed does nothing if you become incapacitated. The property is stuck.

| Situation | TOD Deed | Trust |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| You become incapacitated | Property management impossible without court | Successor trustee manages property |
| Need to sell property for care costs | Court-appointed conservator required | Trustee can sell |
| Refinancing needed | Blocked | Trustee can refinance |

## When TOD Deed Is Better

### Single Property, Simple Beneficiary Situation
- One house
- Goes to one person (or equal shares to children)
- No special conditions on inheritance

### Mortgage Concerns
- Lenders rarely enforce due-on-transfer for trust transfers
- But some owners prefer TOD deeds to avoid any risk
- TOD deed keeps title in your name, eliminating any lender concern

### Cost Sensitivity
- TOD deed: $50-200 (recording fees + possibly form cost)
- Trust: $1,500-3,000+ for full trust package

### Existing Estate Plan Without Trust
- You have a will but no trust
- Want to avoid probate on property without creating trust
- TOD deed adds probate avoidance without full trust restructuring

---

## When Trust Funding Is Better

### Multiple Properties
- Each property needs separate TOD deed
- Trust: One deed to trust for each property, but one trust manages all

### Multiple States
- TOD deed in each state (different state requirements)
- Trust: Avoids ancillary probate in all states

### Complex Distribution Wishes
- TOD deed: Property to named beneficiaries, period
- Trust: "Hold property until youngest child turns 25" or "Spouse can live there for life, then to children"

### Incapacity Planning Priority
- TOD deed: Does nothing during incapacity
- Trust: Successor trustee takes over seamlessly

### Blended Family
- TOD deed: Simple transfer, no conditions
- Trust: QTIP provisions, life estate for spouse, remainder to children

### Special Needs Beneficiary
- TOD deed: Direct transfer (may disqualify from benefits)
- Trust: Can flow to special needs trust provisions

## Tennessee-Specific Guidance

### TOD Deed Effective July 1, 2025
Tennessee enacted TOD deed legislation. Key points:

| Feature | Tennessee TOD Deed |
|---------|-------------------|
| Effective date | July 1, 2025 |
| Recording required | Yes, County Register of Deeds |
| Beneficiary types | Individuals, trusts, charities |
| Revocation | New deed or explicit revocation |
| Contingent beneficiaries | **Allowed** |
| Per stirpes option | **Allowed** |

### When to Use TN TOD Deed

- Simple beneficiary structure
- No existing trust
- No incapacity concerns

### When Trust Still Better in TN
- Own property in multiple counties (trust more efficient)
- Want Community Property Trust (CPT) benefits
- Need incapacity protection
- Complex family situation

---

## Recording Requirements

### TOD Deed
| State | Recording Location | Typical Fee |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Tennessee | County Register of Deeds | $15-30 |
| California | County Recorder | $25-75 |
| Texas | County Clerk | $15-40 |
| Most states | County Recorder/Register | $20-50 |

**Important:** TOD deed must be recorded BEFORE death to be effective.

### Deed to Trust
Same recording requirements as any deed transfer. Additional considerations:
- Some states require trust certification
- May need to record Certificate of Trust
- Transfer tax exemptions usually apply (no tax for transfers to revocable trust)

---

## Lender Considerations

### Mortgage and Due-on-Sale Clause

**Federal Garn-St. Germain Act** protects transfers to trusts:
- Lender cannot call loan due when transferring to revocable trust
- You must remain beneficiary and occupy property
- Most lenders don't enforce anyway

**TOD Deed advantage:**
- Title stays in your name
- No need to notify lender
- Absolutely no due-on-sale concern

---

## Property Tax Considerations

### TOD Deed
- No change during your lifetime
- At death: Beneficiary may face reassessment (state-dependent)
- California Prop 19: May lose property tax base exclusion

### Trust Transfer
- No change during your lifetime (revocable trust)
- At death: Same reassessment issues apply
- California: File Change of Ownership Statement (BOE-502-A) within 90 days

**Bottom line:** Property tax consequences are usually the same regardless of transfer method.

## Can You Use Both?

**Yes, but usually unnecessary.**

Some people use TOD deed as backup:
- Property in trust (primary method)
- TOD deed recorded as backup (in case property accidentally removed from trust)

This is overkill for most situations but can provide extra protection.
