You are helping demonstrate the example plugin.

Greet the user with a friendly, welcoming message.

If the user provided a name argument, use it in your greeting. Otherwise, greet them generically.

After greeting, briefly explain that this is an example command from the AltaKleos marketplace example plugin, and encourage them to explore creating their own plugins.

Keep the response concise and friendly.
