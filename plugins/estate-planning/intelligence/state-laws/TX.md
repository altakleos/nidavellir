## Community Property Rules

Texas is a community property state with strong presumptions:
- Property acquired during marriage presumed community property
- Burden is on spouse claiming separate property to prove it
- Income from separate property is community property (unlike some CP states)
- Each spouse owns 50% of community property

### Separate Property
- Property owned before marriage
- Gifts and inheritances (must keep separately)
- Personal injury recovery (except lost wages)
- Property traced to separate funds

### Partition Agreement
- Spouses can convert community property to separate property
- Must be in writing
- Useful for asset protection and estate planning

## Homestead Protection

Texas has the strongest homestead protection in the US:

### Urban Homestead
- Up to 10 acres
- No dollar limit on value
- Protected from virtually all creditors (except purchase money mortgage, taxes, mechanic's liens)

### Rural Homestead
- Up to 200 acres (family) or 100 acres (single)
- No dollar limit on value

### Homestead and Estate Planning
- Surviving spouse has right to occupy homestead for life
- Cannot be devised away from surviving spouse
- If no surviving spouse, passes to descendants

## Probate Options

### Independent Administration
- Texas strongly favors independent administration
- Minimal court supervision after initial appointment
- Much faster and less expensive than dependent administration
- Will should specifically request independent administration

### Muniment of Title
- Simple procedure to transfer property when:
  - Valid will exists
  - No unpaid debts (other than secured debt)
- Court validates will without full administration
- Commonly used for real estate transfers

### Small Estate Affidavit
- Estates under $75,000 (excluding homestead and exempt property)
- No will required
- 30-day waiting period

## Statutory Durable Power of Attorney

Texas Estates Code provides a statutory form:
- Widely recognized by financial institutions
- Can customize with additions
- Must be signed by principal
- Must be notarized
- Two witnesses not required but recommended

## Directive to Physicians

Texas uses specific form for living will:
- "Directive to Physicians and Family or Surrogates"
- Two witnesses required
- Notarization not required but recommended
- Can include artificial nutrition/hydration preferences

## Medical Power of Attorney

Separate from Directive to Physicians:
- Names healthcare agent
- Two witnesses required (not spouse or healthcare provider)
- Notarization recommended

## Special Considerations

### No State Income Tax
- Trust income not taxed at state level
- Favorable for trust administration

### Texas Trust Code
- Modern trust code (2014 amendments)
- Trust protector provisions available
- Decanting allowed

### Marital Property Agreement
- Pre-marital and post-marital agreements recognized
- Can partition community property
- Can agree income from separate property remains separate

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Not requesting independent administration** in will
2. **Assuming all property is community** without documentation
3. **Overlooking homestead rights** of surviving spouse
4. **Using out-of-state forms** that may not comply with Texas law
5. **Forgetting Directive to Physicians** is separate from Medical POA

## Digital Assets

Texas Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act:
- Fiduciaries can access digital assets if authorized
- Specific authorization in estate documents recommended
- Platform terms may limit access

## Witness Requirements

Witnesses must:
- Be 14+ years old (lower than most states)
- Be competent
- Not need to be disinterested (though recommended)
- Sign in testator's presence
