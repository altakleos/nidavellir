## Healthcare Documents

### Advance Directive for Health Care
Alabama combines living will and healthcare proxy:
- Two witnesses required
- Notarization NOT required
- Statutory form (Ala. Code § 22-8A-4)
- Can separate agent designation from treatment wishes

### Witness Requirements
Witnesses cannot be:
- Under 19 years old (Alabama's age of majority is 19)
- The healthcare proxy (agent)
- Related by blood or marriage
- Entitled to any portion of estate
- Provider of healthcare

### DNR Order
- Separate from advance directive
- Physician order
- Applies to resuscitation specifically

## Probate

### Full Administration
- Probate court in county of residence
- Letters testamentary issued to executor
- Standard supervised administration

### Summary Distribution
- Estates under $25,000 in personal property
- Simplified procedure
- 30-day waiting period

### Small Estate Affidavit
- Very small estates
- No formal administration
- Affidavit procedure

### Muniment of Title
- Alabama does NOT have muniment of title
- Must use full or summary administration

## Special Considerations

### Alabama Uniform Trust Code
- Adopted modern trust code
- Trust protector provisions
- Decanting allowed
- Nonjudicial modification available

### Age of Majority
- Alabama: **19 years old** (unusual)
- Affects witness requirements
- Affects guardianship termination
- One of only two states with 19 (Nebraska is other)

### Tenancy by the Entirety
- Available for married couples (real property)
- Creditor protection benefits
- Automatic right of survivorship

### Homestead Exemption
- $15,000 value (160 acres rural, 1/2 acre urban)
- Plus property tax exemption for primary residence
- Additional exemptions for seniors and disabled

### Pretermitted Heirs
- Children born after will may take intestate share
- Strong protection for after-born children
- Will should specifically address

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Age of majority is 19** - Witnesses must be 19+, not 18
2. **Witness restrictions for healthcare directive** - Comprehensive exclusions
3. **POA needs both witness AND notary** - Missing either problematic
4. **No muniment of title** - Must go through administration
5. **Elective share calculation** - Complex with $50,000 floor

## Transfer on Death Instruments

### TOD Deed
- Alabama does NOT have TOD deed statute
- Must use trust or joint ownership for real estate

### TOD Securities
- Standard TOD registration available
- Bank POD accounts allowed

### Real Estate Planning
- Trust most effective for real estate probate avoidance
- Joint tenancy with right of survivorship (but careful of gift implications)
- Enhanced life estate deed (Lady Bird) NOT recognized
