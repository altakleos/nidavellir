# Florida (FL) - Estate Planning Requirements

**Tier:** 1 (Full Documentation)
**Property Type:** Common Law
**Population Rank:** 3
**State Tax:** None (no state income tax either)

## Execution Requirements

| Document | Witnesses | Notarization | Special Requirements |
|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Will | **2** | Required for self-proving | In-person only; remote notarization NOT allowed for wills |
| Trust | N/A | Required | Standard notary acknowledgment |
| POA | **2** | Required | Both witnesses AND notary required |
| Healthcare Directive | 2 | Required | Both witnesses AND notary required |

**IMPORTANT**: Florida is strict about will execution:
- Remote online notarization (RON) is NOT allowed for wills
- Electronic wills ARE allowed (separate requirements with audio-video supervision)
- In-person signing with proper witnesses is the safe approach

## Constitutional Homestead Protection

Florida's homestead protection is constitutional and extremely strong:

### Creditor Protection
- **Unlimited value** - No dollar cap on protection
- **Size limits**: 0.5 acre (urban) or 160 acres (rural)
- Protected from forced sale by most creditors
- Even bankruptcy cannot force sale of homestead

### Descent and Devise Restrictions (CRITICAL)

**Florida homestead CANNOT be freely devised if survived by spouse AND minor children:**

| Surviving Family | What Happens to Homestead |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Spouse + descendants | Spouse gets life estate; descendants get remainder |
| Spouse only | Spouse inherits fee simple |
| Descendants only | Descendants inherit per stirpes |

**"Safe Harbor" Election (F.S. §732.401):**
- Within 6 months of death, spouse and descendants may elect:
  - Spouse takes 50% fee simple
  - Descendants take 50% fee simple (divided equally)

### Homestead and Trusts
- Homestead CAN be placed in revocable trust
- Must be carefully drafted to preserve protection
- Constitutional protection follows the property

### Property Tax Reset Warning
- When homestead passes to non-spouse/non-dependent child
- Assessed value RESETS to full market value
- Can result in dramatic property tax increase
- 2025: Save Our Homes cap is 2.9% maximum annual increase

## Probate

### Formal Administration
- Required for estates over $75,000
- Requires attorney in Florida
- Typical timeline: 6 months to 1 year

### Summary Administration
- Estates under $75,000, OR
- Decedent dead more than 2 years
- Faster and less expensive

### Disposition Without Administration
- Estates consisting only of exempt property and non-exempt assets less than $6,000
- Very limited use

## Elective Share

- Surviving spouse entitled to 30% of "elective estate"
- Elective estate includes:
  - Probate assets
  - Revocable trust assets
  - Joint accounts with right of survivorship
  - Certain life insurance and retirement accounts
- More expansive than many states

## Power of Attorney

Florida is particularly strict about POA:
- **Must be signed by TWO witnesses**
- **Must be notarized**
- Specific statutory form recommended for acceptance
- Springing POAs difficult to use in practice

### Super Powers
These require specific grant in POA:
- Creating/revoking trusts
- Making gifts
- Designating beneficiaries
- Waiving rights

## Healthcare Documents

### Designation of Health Care Surrogate
- Names healthcare agent
- Two witnesses required
- Notarization required

### Living Will
- Separate from surrogate designation
- Two witnesses required
- Notarization required

## Special Considerations

### Non-Resident Alien Issues
- Florida's homestead and elective share can affect non-US citizens
- Careful planning needed for international families

### Lady Bird Deed (Enhanced Life Estate)
- Allowed in Florida
- Avoids probate while retaining homestead
- Grantor keeps right to sell, mortgage, revoke
- Popular alternative to trust for simple situations

### Land Trust
- Florida recognizes land trusts
- Can provide privacy for real estate ownership
- Does not avoid probate on its own

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Attempting remote notarization of wills** - Invalid in Florida
2. **Leaving homestead to trust without proper drafting** - May lose protection
3. **Forgetting spousal elective share** - Trust assets included
4. **Using out-of-state POA forms** - May not be accepted
5. **Not understanding homestead descent restrictions** - Estate plan fails
6. **Blended family + homestead** - Creates forced life estate for spouse

## Amendment 5 (2024)

- Inflation adjustment to second $25,000 homestead exemption
- Applies to property taxes
- Separate from constitutional homestead protection

## Witness Requirements

Witnesses must:
- Be 18+ years old
- Be competent
- Sign in testator's presence AND in presence of each other
- Be disinterested (not beneficiaries) recommended
