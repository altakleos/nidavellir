## Key Features

### Inheritance Tax
- **Exempt beneficiaries**: Spouse, lineal descendants, lineal ascendants, stepchildren
- Taxable transfers: Siblings, others
- Rates: 2% to 15% depending on relationship
- Charity exempt

### Transfer on Death Deed
- Iowa does NOT have TOD deed for real estate
- Must use trust or joint ownership

### Probate
- Supervised administration is standard
- Unsupervised administration available if authorized

## Elective Share
- Surviving spouse: 1/3 of estate (or all personal property up to $25,000)
- Plus homestead rights

## Common Considerations
1. Inheritance tax affects siblings and others (not lineal family)
2. No TOD deed - use revocable trust for real estate
3. Farmland succession planning important in Iowa
4. Dower/homestead rights affect real estate transfers
