## Key Features

### Community Property State
- Property acquired during marriage is community
- Each spouse owns 50%
- Double step-up in basis at death
- Income from separate property remains separate (unlike TX)

### No State Death Taxes
- No estate tax
- No inheritance tax
- Tax-friendly state

### Transfer on Death Deed
- Idaho has TOD deed for real estate
- Avoids probate
- Revocable during lifetime

## Elective Share
- No traditional elective share (community property state)
- Community property protections instead
- Surviving spouse owns 50% of community automatically

## Common Considerations
1. Document community vs. separate property
2. Use TOD deed for real estate probate avoidance
3. Quasi-community property rules for property acquired elsewhere
4. Agricultural and ranching property considerations
