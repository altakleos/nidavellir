Two witnesses required where **at least one**:
- Is not related by blood, marriage, or adoption
- Is not entitled to any portion of the estate

**Both witnesses must be:**
- 18+ years old
- Not financially responsible for healthcare

- Distinctive form

## Probate

- Less court involvement

## Special Considerations

### Tennessee Investment Services Act (Dynasty Trusts)
- Tennessee allows dynasty trusts up to **360 years**
- Rule against perpetuities replaced with 360-year limit
- Favorable trust jurisdiction
- Asset protection trust provisions (2007)

### Tennessee Asset Protection Trust
- Domestic asset protection trust (DAPT) available
- Self-settled spendthrift trusts allowed
- Must meet specific requirements
- **18-month** fraudulent transfer lookback (general creditors)
- **6-month** lookback if creditors properly notified
- Note: TennCare/Medicaid has separate 5-year lookback

### Tenancy by the Entirety
- Available for married couples
- Real and personal property (per *Bryant v. Bryant*, 2017)
- Strong creditor protection (from one spouse's individual creditors)
- Automatic right of survivorship

**Exceptions to TBE protection:**
- Joint debts (co-signed by both spouses)
- Federal tax liens
- Converts to tenancy in common upon divorce

### Homestead Exemption
- Single owner: **$35,000** (updated January 2022)
- Joint married owners: **$52,500**
- Additional exemption for surviving spouse and minor children
- Must be designated in writing to claim
- Note: 40-month residency requirement for full federal bankruptcy exemption

### Community Property Trust Option
Tennessee allows married couples to opt into community property:
- Tennessee Community Property Trust Act (2010)
- Creates community property for trust assets
- Provides step-up in basis benefit at first death
- Unique planning opportunity

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Assuming old inheritance tax rules** - Fully repealed by 2016
2. **Not utilizing community property trust** - Unique TN advantage
3. **Low homestead exemption** - Only $5,000 protected
4. **Springing POA difficulties** - Immediate recommended
5. **Healthcare advance directive flexibility** - Either witnesses OR notary
6. **Dynasty trust opportunities missed** - No perpetuities rule for trusts

## Transfer on Death Instruments

### TOD Deed
- Tennessee enacted TOD deed statute effective **July 1, 2025** (SB0984)
- Prior to July 2025: Must use trust or other methods for real estate

- Standard TOD registration available
- Bank POD accounts allowed
- Vehicles can have TOD beneficiary
