## Special Considerations

### Tennessee Investment Services Act (Dynasty Trusts)

- 2-year (good faith) to 4-year fraudulent transfer lookback

### Tenancy by the Entirety

- Automatic right of survivorship

### Homestead Exemption

### Community Property Trust Option

## Common Pitfalls

3. **Low homestead exemption** - Only $5,000 protected
4. **Springing POA difficulties** - Immediate recommended
5. **Healthcare advance directive flexibility** - Either witnesses OR notary
6. **Dynasty trust opportunities missed** - No perpetuities rule for trusts
