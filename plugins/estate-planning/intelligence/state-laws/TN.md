## Special Considerations

### Tennessee Investment Services Act (Dynasty Trusts)
- Tennessee allows dynasty trusts up to **360 years**
- Rule against perpetuities replaced with 360-year limit
- Favorable trust jurisdiction
- Asset protection trust provisions (2007)

### Tennessee Asset Protection Trust
- Domestic asset protection trust (DAPT) available
- Self-settled spendthrift trusts allowed
- Must meet specific requirements
- **18-month** fraudulent transfer lookback (general creditors)
- **6-month** lookback if creditors properly notified
- Note: TennCare/Medicaid has separate 5-year lookback

### Tenancy by the Entirety
- Available for married couples
- Real and personal property (per *Bryant v. Bryant*, 2017)
- Strong creditor protection (from one spouse's individual creditors)
- Automatic right of survivorship

**Exceptions to TBE protection:**
- Joint debts (co-signed by both spouses)
- Federal tax liens
- Converts to tenancy in common upon divorce

### Homestead Exemption
- Single owner: **$35,000** (updated January 2022)
- Joint married owners: **$52,500**
- Additional exemption for surviving spouse and minor children
- Must be designated in writing to claim
- Note: 40-month residency requirement for full federal bankruptcy exemption

### Community Property Trust Option
Tennessee allows married couples to opt into community property:
- Tennessee Community Property Trust Act (2010)
- Creates community property for trust assets
- Provides step-up in basis benefit at first death
- Unique planning opportunity

## TennCare (Tennessee Medicaid)

### Overview
TennCare is Tennessee's Medicaid program with specific planning implications.

### Transfer Lookback
- **5-year lookback** for all transfers
- Applies to gifts, trust funding, and asset transfers
- Different from DAPT lookback (18 months for creditors)
- Transfers during lookback may trigger penalty period

### Waiver Programs
Tennessee offers several home and community-based waiver programs:

| Program | Purpose | Who It Serves |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **CHOICES** | Long-term services and supports | Elderly and adults with physical disabilities |
| **ECF** (Employment and Community First) | Community integration and employment | Adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities |
| **Katie Beckett** | Home care for children | Children with disabilities who would otherwise require institutional care |

### Special Needs Planning
- Third-party SNTs protect TennCare eligibility
- First-party SNTs require TennCare payback at death
- ABLE TN accounts available (www.abletn.gov)
- Pooled trust options for beneficiaries 65+

### Asset Recovery
- TennCare may seek recovery from estates
- Applies to properly transferred probate estates
- Proper SNT planning can avoid recovery
- Homestead may be subject to recovery after both spouses deceased

## Property Titling for Tennessee Residents

### Tenancy by the Entirety (TBE)
**Recommended for married couples' assets:**
- Available for both real and personal property
- Strongest creditor protection in Tennessee
- Automatic survivorship
- Cannot be severed unilaterally

**How to Title for TBE:**
- Real property: "[Spouse 1] and [Spouse 2], husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety"
- Financial accounts: Both spouses named with TBE designation

### Trust Funding for Real Estate
When funding real estate into revocable trust:
1. **Quitclaim deed** or **warranty deed** to trust
2. Record with county register of deeds
3. No transfer tax for trust funding (exempt)
4. Update homeowners insurance with trust as named insured
5. Notify mortgage company (due-on-sale rarely enforced for revocable trusts)

### Mortgage Considerations
- Tennessee is a **title theory** state
- Deed of trust used (not mortgage)
- Trust funding generally doesn't trigger due-on-sale clause (per Garn-St. Germain Act)

## Common Pitfalls

### For All Tennessee Residents
1. **Assuming old inheritance tax rules** - Fully repealed by 2016
2. **Not utilizing community property trust** - Unique TN advantage for step-up in basis
3. **Missing homestead designation** - Must be claimed in writing; protects $35,000/$52,500
4. **Springing POA difficulties** - Immediate effectiveness recommended
5. **Healthcare advance directive confusion** - Either witnesses OR notary (not both required)
6. **Dynasty trust opportunities missed** - 360-year trust duration available

### For Special Needs Planning
7. **Confusing DAPT and TennCare lookbacks** - DAPT is 18 months; TennCare is 5 years
8. **Not funding real estate into trust** - Assets must be titled in trust name to avoid probate
9. **Wrong SNT type** - Third-party SNT (no payback) vs. first-party SNT (payback required)
10. **Missing Letter of Intent** - Critical companion document for SNT trustees
11. **Not coordinating with ABLE account** - ABLE TN can complement SNT planning
12. **Ignoring TennCare waiver programs** - CHOICES and ECF provide valuable services

## Transfer on Death Instruments

### TOD Deed
- Tennessee enacted TOD deed statute effective **July 1, 2025** (SB0984)
- Prior to July 2025: Must use trust or other methods for real estate

### TOD Securities
- Standard TOD registration available
- Bank POD accounts allowed
- Vehicles can have TOD beneficiary
