## Illinois Estate Tax

Illinois has a separate estate tax with lower threshold than federal:

### Tax Structure
- **Exemption**: $4,000,000 (not portable between spouses)
- **Graduated rates**: 0.8% to 16%
- **Top rate kicks in**: at approximately $10.04M

### Rate Schedule (Approximate)
| Taxable Amount | Marginal Rate |
|----------------|---------------|
| $0 - $40,000 | 0.8% |
| $40,000 - $4M | Progressive |
| $4M+ | Up to 16% |

### Key Differences from Federal
- No portability - each spouse needs own planning
- Lower threshold triggers planning at $4M, not $13.99M
- Separate filing required (not just federal Form 706)

### Credit Shelter Trust
- Still commonly used in Illinois due to no portability
- First spouse's $4M exemption used at first death
- Prevents "stacking" but preserves both exemptions

## Elective Share

Illinois provides spousal protection:
- **1/3 of estate** if decedent has descendants
- **1/2 of estate** if no descendants
- Applies to probate estate
- Does NOT include revocable trust assets (unlike some states)

## Power of Attorney

Illinois has two statutory POA forms:

### Property POA (Illinois Statutory Short Form)
- One witness required
- Notarization required
- Covers financial matters
- Immediate or springing

### Healthcare POA
- One witness required
- Notarization not required
- Separate from property POA

### Agent's Acceptance
- Agent should sign acceptance
- Acknowledged before notary recommended

## Healthcare Documents

### Healthcare Power of Attorney
- Names healthcare agent
- Can include treatment preferences
- Statutory form in 755 ILCS 45

### Living Will
- Separate from healthcare POA
- Two witnesses required
- Specific form not required

### POLST
- Illinois has POLST program
- Physician orders for life-sustaining treatment
- Bright pink form

## Real Estate Transfer Tax

When funding trust with real estate:
- **Real Estate Transfer Declaration** required
- State tax: $0.50 per $500 of value
- County tax: $0.25 per $500 (most counties)
- Chicago: Additional municipal transfer tax
- Exempt transfers (gifts, trust funding) require declaration but minimal tax

## Probate

### Independent Administration
- Illinois favors independent administration
- Minimal court supervision
- Must be authorized in will or by heirs

### Supervised Administration
- Court approval for all transactions
- More expensive and time-consuming
- Required if disputes or minor beneficiaries

### Small Estate Affidavit
- Personal property under $100,000
- No real estate in estate
- 30-day waiting period

## Special Considerations

### Illinois Trust Code
- Comprehensive trust law
- Trust protector provisions
- Decanting allowed
- Virtual representation for beneficiaries

### Land Trusts
- Illinois originated land trusts
- Privacy of ownership
- Does not avoid probate
- Common in Chicago area

### Homestead Exemption
- $15,000 protection from creditors
- Much lower than other states
- Property tax exemption separate

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Ignoring state estate tax** - $4M threshold catches many families
2. **Relying on portability** - Doesn't exist for IL tax
3. **Old estate plans** - May not account for IL tax
4. **Using wrong POA form** - Property vs Healthcare are separate
5. **Forgetting Real Estate Transfer Declaration**
6. **Chicago transfer taxes** - Separate and substantial

## TOD Instruments

Illinois allows Transfer on Death for:
- Securities (TOD registration)
- Real estate (TOD deed)
- Vehicles (TOD beneficiary)
- Avoids probate for these assets

## Witness Requirements

Witnesses for will must:
- Be 18+ years old
- Be competent
- Sign in presence of testator
- Disinterested recommended

Witnesses for POA:
- Only one required
- Must be 18+
- Cannot be the agent
