# Louisiana (LA) - Estate Planning Requirements

**Tier:** 2 (Standard Documentation)
**Property Type:** Community Property (Civil Law System)
**State Tax:** None

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: CIVIL LAW JURISDICTION

**Louisiana is the ONLY civil law state in the US. Its legal system derives from French/Spanish civil law tradition, NOT English common law. Estate planning documents from other states are often INVALID in Louisiana.**

### Key Differences from All Other States:
- **Forced heirship** - Children may have protected inheritance rights
- **Usufruct** - Unique life estate concept
- **Legitime** - Forced portion for children
- **Different terminology** - Succession (not probate), legatee (not beneficiary)
- **Different document requirements** - Notarial vs. olographic wills

## Execution Requirements

| Document | Witnesses | Notarization | Special Requirements |
|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Notarial Will | 2 | Required | Notary + 2 witnesses; read aloud |
| Olographic Will | 0 | Not allowed | Entirely handwritten, dated, signed |
| Trust | N/A | Required | Must comply with Trust Code |
| POA | 2 | Required | Mandate (civil law term) |
| Healthcare | 2 | Not required | Declaration |

## Forced Heirship (Legitime)

### Protected Heirs ("Forced Heirs")
- Children who have not attained age 23 (per LA Civil Code Art. 1493)
- Children of any age who are permanently incapable (mental or physical)

### Forced Portion
- One child: 1/4 of estate
- Two+ children: 1/2 of estate divided equally

### Disposable Portion
- Portion that CAN be freely given
- 3/4 (one forced heir) or 1/2 (two+ forced heirs)

**CRITICAL**: You cannot fully disinherit forced heirs!

## Community Property (Civil Law Version)

### Community of Acquets and Gains
- Different from other CP states
- Property acquired during marriage is community
- "Fruits" of separate property are community
- Can be modified by matrimonial agreement

### Separate Property
- Property owned before marriage
- Gifts and inheritances
- Property acquired with separate funds (must trace)

## Usufruct

### Concept
Unique to civil law - separates ownership from use:
- **Naked owner**: Owns property but cannot use
- **Usufructuary**: Can use and benefit but doesn't own

### Surviving Spouse Usufruct
- Surviving spouse gets usufruct over deceased's community property
- Terminates on remarriage or death
- Children are naked owners

## Will Types in Louisiana

### Notarial Testament (Recommended)
1. Typed document
2. Testator declares it's their will
3. Read aloud in presence of notary and 2 witnesses
4. Testator signs each page
5. Notary and witnesses sign attestation

### Olographic Testament
1. Entirely handwritten by testator
2. Dated by testator's hand
3. Signed by testator
4. No witnesses or notary (but notarization doesn't invalidate)

### Statutory Testament
Available for certain situations (less common)

## Succession (Probate)

### Terminology
- "Succession" = Probate
- "Legatee" = Beneficiary
- "Decedent" = Same as common law

### Types
- **Testate succession**: With valid will
- **Intestate succession**: Without will
- **Small succession**: Simplified for small estates

## POA in Louisiana

### Called "Mandate"
- Written mandate for financial matters
- Must be notarized with 2 witnesses
- Can include specific or general powers
- Must specifically grant powers (no statutory form)

## Healthcare Directive

### Declaration
- Living will for end-of-life
- Two witnesses required
- Specific statutory form

### Healthcare POA
- Separate from living will
- Names healthcare agent

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Using out-of-state forms** - Almost always invalid in Louisiana
2. **Ignoring forced heirship** - Cannot disinherit protected children
3. **Common law terminology** - Louisiana uses different terms
4. **Not understanding usufruct** - Unique ownership concept
5. **Assuming trust avoids forced heirship** - May not fully work

## Recommendation

> **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**: Louisiana residents should work with a Louisiana-licensed attorney for ALL estate planning documents. The civil law system is fundamentally different from every other state. Documents valid elsewhere may be completely invalid in Louisiana.

## Common Considerations
1. Always use Louisiana-specific documents
2. Plan around forced heirship if applicable
3. Understand usufruct implications
4. Community property has unique Louisiana rules
5. "Succession" process through Louisiana courts
