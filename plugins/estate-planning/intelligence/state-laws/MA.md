## Key Features

### Estate Tax - LOW EXEMPTION
- Exemption: **$2 million** (one of lowest in nation)
- Maximum rate: 16%
- Decoupled from federal
- **CRITICAL**: Affects many more estates than federal tax

### Tax Structure
- Graduated rates
- Starts at ~0.8% on first taxable amount
- Highest rates apply to larger estates
- No portability of exemption between spouses

### Massachusetts Uniform Trust Code
- Adopted in 2012
- Modern trust provisions
- Trust protector allowed

## Elective Share
- Surviving spouse: dower/curtesy (life estate in 1/3 of real property)
- Or statutory share (varies by circumstances)
- Complex rules based on property types

## Common Considerations
1. **$2M exemption catches many families** - most need planning
2. No portability - both spouses need to use exemption
3. Credit shelter trust still very relevant
4. Real estate values in metro Boston often exceed threshold
5. Review plans regularly as values appreciate
