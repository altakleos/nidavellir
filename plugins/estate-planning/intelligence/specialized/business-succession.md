# Business Succession Planning

## Overview

Business succession planning ensures smooth transition of business ownership and management upon owner's retirement, incapacity, or death. It protects business value, employees, and family.

## Types of Business Entities

### Sole Proprietorship
- No separate legal entity
- Business dies with owner
- Assets pass through probate
- Highest planning need

### Partnership (General and Limited)
- Partnership agreement governs succession
- May dissolve on partner's death without planning
- Buy-sell agreements critical

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)
- Operating agreement governs
- Membership interest is personal property
- Flexible succession options

### Corporation (C-Corp and S-Corp)
- Stock is transferred
- Shareholder agreements important
- S-Corp has ownership restrictions

## Entity Transfer Restrictions (Trust Funding)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Before transferring business interests into a revocable trust, review entity-specific restrictions.

### LLC Interests

**Before funding LLC into trust:**
1. **Review operating agreement** for transfer restrictions
2. Check if member consent is required
3. Verify trust qualifies as "permitted transferee"
4. Confirm transfer won't trigger buy-sell provisions

**Common restrictions:**
- Right of first refusal for other members
- Approval required from managing member
- Limitations on transferring to non-family trusts

**Solution:** Amend operating agreement to:
- Add revocable trust as permitted transferee
- Confirm trust ownership doesn't change member status
- Clarify what happens when trust becomes irrevocable at death

### S-Corporation Stock

⚠️ **S-Corp ownership is heavily restricted by IRS rules.**

**Eligible shareholders for S-Corps:**
- U.S. citizens and resident aliens
- Certain trusts (see below)
- Estates (temporary)
- **NOT:** Corporations, partnerships, non-resident aliens

**Trust eligibility during grantor's lifetime:**
- Revocable trusts: ✅ Eligible (treated as grantor trust)
- Grantor trusts: ✅ Eligible

**After grantor's death - CRITICAL:**
- Trust has **2-year grace period** after grantor's death
- Must make election or distribute stock within 2 years
- Failure to act = **S-Corp status terminates** (becomes C-Corp)

**Post-death options:**

| Option | Requirement | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **QSST** (Qualified Subchapter S Trust) | Single beneficiary, all income distributed | Simple family succession |
| **ESBT** (Electing Small Business Trust) | Election made, special tax rules | Multiple beneficiaries |
| **Distribute stock** | Give shares to individuals | Exiting trust ownership |

**QSST Requirements:**
- Only one income beneficiary
- All trust income distributed annually
- Corpus distributions only to income beneficiary
- Beneficiary makes election

**ESBT Requirements:**
- Election filed with IRS
- S-Corp income taxed at highest marginal rate (37% in 2025)
- More flexibility but higher taxes

[[ ATTORNEY REVIEW: S-Corp trust ownership requires careful planning. Ensure
   proper elections are made timely. Failure terminates S-Corp status. ]]

### C-Corporation Stock

**No ownership restrictions** - Trusts can freely hold C-Corp stock.

**Considerations:**
- Check bylaws for right of first refusal
- Shareholder agreements may restrict transfers
- Board notification may be required
- Stock certificates may need reissuance in trust name

### Partnership Interests (General and Limited)

**General Partner interest:**
- May require consent of other partners
- Trust may not be able to serve as GP
- Consider retaining GP interest personally

**Limited Partner interest:**
- Usually transferable to trust
- Check partnership agreement
- LP units typically have fewer restrictions

### Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs)

**Special considerations:**
- GP interest often kept outside trust for control
- LP interests transferred to trust for discount planning
- Partnership agreement should explicitly permit trust as LP
- Consider whether transferring defeats asset protection goals

## Exit Strategies

### Transfer to Family
**Options:**
- Gift shares over time
- Sell to family (installment)
- Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)
- Family Limited Partnership (FLP)
- Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)

**Considerations:**
- Active vs. passive family members
- Equal treatment vs. business management needs
- Estate tax planning
- Income tax step-up vs. carryover basis

### Sell to Employees
**ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan):**
- Tax-advantaged sale
- Employees become owners
- Deferred capital gains (C-Corp)
- Complex but powerful

**Management Buyout:**
- Key employees purchase
- Often with seller financing
- Transition period common

### Sell to Third Party
**Options:**
- Strategic buyer (competitor, larger company)
- Financial buyer (private equity)
- Business broker facilitated

**Considerations:**
- Maximize value
- Due diligence requirements
- Non-compete agreements
- Earnout provisions

### Orderly Liquidation
- When no succession available
- Maximize asset value
- Wind down operations
- Distribute proceeds

## Buy-Sell Agreements

### What is a Buy-Sell?
Contract that governs what happens to business interest when owner:
- Dies
- Becomes disabled
- Retires
- Divorces
- Goes bankrupt
- Wants to sell

### Types of Buy-Sell Agreements

**Cross-Purchase:**
- Owners agree to buy each other's interest
- Works best with few owners
- Each owner typically owns life insurance on others
- Purchasing owner gets stepped-up basis

**Redemption (Entity Purchase):**
- Business buys the interest
- Business owns insurance policies
- Simpler with many owners
- No basis step-up for remaining owners

**Wait-and-See (Hybrid):**
- Combines both approaches
- Flexibility to choose at trigger event
- More complex but adaptable

### Funding Buy-Sell

**Life Insurance:**
- Most common funding method
- Provides immediate liquidity
- Policy type matters (term vs. permanent)

**Installment Payments:**
- Seller financing
- Risk of default
- May not provide immediate cash to estate

**Sinking Fund:**
- Business sets aside money over time
- Rarely sufficient alone
- Good supplement

### Valuation in Buy-Sell

**Options:**
- Fixed price (dangerous if not updated)
- Formula (multiple of revenue, earnings)
- Appraisal (at trigger event or periodically)
- Combination approach

**Critical:** IRS may challenge undervalued buy-sells for estate tax purposes.

## Key Person Insurance

### Purpose
Compensate business for loss of critical employee (owner, key manager, salesperson).

### Uses
- Replace lost revenue during transition
- Recruit and train replacement
- Pay off business debts
- Reassure customers and creditors

### Tax Treatment
- Premiums not deductible
- Death benefit generally tax-free to business
- Must follow notice and consent requirements

## Estate Planning Integration

### Coordinating Documents

**Will/Trust should:**
- Address business interest disposition
- Coordinate with buy-sell agreement
- Consider active vs. passive beneficiaries
- Plan for estate taxes

**Power of Attorney should:**
- Grant authority to manage business
- May need separate business POA
- Address voting and management decisions

### Estate Tax Considerations

**Valuation Discounts:**
- Minority interest discount
- Lack of marketability discount
- Must be properly documented

**Section 6166:**
- Installment payment of estate tax
- Available for closely held business
- Interest deferred up to 5 years
- Payments over 10 years

**Section 303:**
- Stock redemption to pay estate taxes
- Treated as sale, not dividend

## Common Structures

### Family Limited Partnership (FLP)
- Parents create partnership
- Gift limited partnership interests to children
- Claim valuation discounts
- Maintain control through general partner interest
- IRS scrutinizes aggressive discounts

### Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)
- Transfer appreciating business interest
- Receive annuity payments
- Remainder to heirs at reduced gift tax
- "Zeroed-out" GRAT minimizes gift

### Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)
- Irrevocable trust for income tax, completed gift for transfer tax
- Sell business interest to trust for note
- Grantor pays income tax (tax-free gift to trust)
- Appreciation escapes estate

## Common Mistakes

1. **No succession plan** - Business fails without owner
2. **No buy-sell agreement** - Heirs stuck with partner they didn't choose
3. **Outdated buy-sell valuation** - Either too high or too low
4. **Inadequate funding** - Buy-sell can't be executed
5. **Not involving family** - Surprises create conflict
6. **Ignoring key employees** - They leave for certainty elsewhere
7. **All eggs in one basket** - Estate concentrated in illiquid business
8. **No management succession** - Business depends entirely on owner
