# Business Succession Planning

## Overview

Business succession planning ensures smooth transition of business ownership and management upon owner's retirement, incapacity, or death. It protects business value, employees, and family.

## Types of Business Entities

### Sole Proprietorship
- No separate legal entity
- Business dies with owner
- Assets pass through probate
- Highest planning need

### Partnership (General and Limited)
- Partnership agreement governs succession
- May dissolve on partner's death without planning
- Buy-sell agreements critical

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)
- Operating agreement governs
- Membership interest is personal property
- Flexible succession options

### Corporation (C-Corp and S-Corp)
- Stock is transferred
- Shareholder agreements important
- S-Corp has ownership restrictions

## Exit Strategies

### Transfer to Family
**Options:**
- Gift shares over time
- Sell to family (installment)
- Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)
- Family Limited Partnership (FLP)
- Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)

**Considerations:**
- Active vs. passive family members
- Equal treatment vs. business management needs
- Estate tax planning
- Income tax step-up vs. carryover basis

### Sell to Employees
**ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan):**
- Tax-advantaged sale
- Employees become owners
- Deferred capital gains (C-Corp)
- Complex but powerful

**Management Buyout:**
- Key employees purchase
- Often with seller financing
- Transition period common

### Sell to Third Party
**Options:**
- Strategic buyer (competitor, larger company)
- Financial buyer (private equity)
- Business broker facilitated

**Considerations:**
- Maximize value
- Due diligence requirements
- Non-compete agreements
- Earnout provisions

### Orderly Liquidation
- When no succession available
- Maximize asset value
- Wind down operations
- Distribute proceeds

## Buy-Sell Agreements

### What is a Buy-Sell?
Contract that governs what happens to business interest when owner:
- Dies
- Becomes disabled
- Retires
- Divorces
- Goes bankrupt
- Wants to sell

### Types of Buy-Sell Agreements

**Cross-Purchase:**
- Owners agree to buy each other's interest
- Works best with few owners
- Each owner typically owns life insurance on others
- Purchasing owner gets stepped-up basis

**Redemption (Entity Purchase):**
- Business buys the interest
- Business owns insurance policies
- Simpler with many owners
- No basis step-up for remaining owners

**Wait-and-See (Hybrid):**
- Combines both approaches
- Flexibility to choose at trigger event
- More complex but adaptable

### Funding Buy-Sell

**Life Insurance:**
- Most common funding method
- Provides immediate liquidity
- Policy type matters (term vs. permanent)

**Installment Payments:**
- Seller financing
- Risk of default
- May not provide immediate cash to estate

**Sinking Fund:**
- Business sets aside money over time
- Rarely sufficient alone
- Good supplement

### Valuation in Buy-Sell

**Options:**
- Fixed price (dangerous if not updated)
- Formula (multiple of revenue, earnings)
- Appraisal (at trigger event or periodically)
- Combination approach

**Critical:** IRS may challenge undervalued buy-sells for estate tax purposes.

## Key Person Insurance

### Purpose
Compensate business for loss of critical employee (owner, key manager, salesperson).

### Uses
- Replace lost revenue during transition
- Recruit and train replacement
- Pay off business debts
- Reassure customers and creditors

### Tax Treatment
- Premiums not deductible
- Death benefit generally tax-free to business
- Must follow notice and consent requirements

## Estate Planning Integration

### Coordinating Documents

**Will/Trust should:**
- Address business interest disposition
- Coordinate with buy-sell agreement
- Consider active vs. passive beneficiaries
- Plan for estate taxes

**Power of Attorney should:**
- Grant authority to manage business
- May need separate business POA
- Address voting and management decisions

### Estate Tax Considerations

**Valuation Discounts:**
- Minority interest discount
- Lack of marketability discount
- Must be properly documented

**Section 6166:**
- Installment payment of estate tax
- Available for closely held business
- Interest deferred up to 5 years
- Payments over 10 years

**Section 303:**
- Stock redemption to pay estate taxes
- Treated as sale, not dividend

## Common Structures

### Family Limited Partnership (FLP)
- Parents create partnership
- Gift limited partnership interests to children
- Claim valuation discounts
- Maintain control through general partner interest
- IRS scrutinizes aggressive discounts

### Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)
- Transfer appreciating business interest
- Receive annuity payments
- Remainder to heirs at reduced gift tax
- "Zeroed-out" GRAT minimizes gift

### Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)
- Irrevocable trust for income tax, completed gift for transfer tax
- Sell business interest to trust for note
- Grantor pays income tax (tax-free gift to trust)
- Appreciation escapes estate

## Common Mistakes

1. **No succession plan** - Business fails without owner
2. **No buy-sell agreement** - Heirs stuck with partner they didn't choose
3. **Outdated buy-sell valuation** - Either too high or too low
4. **Inadequate funding** - Buy-sell can't be executed
5. **Not involving family** - Surprises create conflict
6. **Ignoring key employees** - They leave for certainty elsewhere
7. **All eggs in one basket** - Estate concentrated in illiquid business
8. **No management succession** - Business depends entirely on owner
