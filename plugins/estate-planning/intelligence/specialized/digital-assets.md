# Digital Assets Estate Planning

## Overview

Digital assets have become a significant part of most people's estates. Proper planning ensures fiduciaries can access and manage these assets after incapacity or death.

## Types of Digital Assets

### Financial Digital Assets
- **Cryptocurrency**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, other coins and tokens
- **Online banking**: Accounts, statements, bill pay
- **Investment accounts**: Brokerage, robo-advisors
- **Payment services**: PayPal, Venmo, Cash App
- **Online-only banks**: Ally, Marcus, etc.

### Business Digital Assets
- **Domain names**: Website addresses
- **Websites and blogs**: Content, hosting
- **E-commerce**: Shopify stores, Amazon seller accounts
- **Digital products**: eBooks, courses, software
- **Business social media**: Company accounts

### Personal Digital Assets
- **Email accounts**: Gmail, Outlook, etc.
- **Social media**: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn
- **Photos and videos**: iCloud, Google Photos, local storage
- **Digital music and media**: iTunes, Spotify playlists
- **Gaming accounts**: Steam, PlayStation, Xbox
- **Cloud storage**: Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive
- **Subscriptions**: Netflix, software licenses

## Legal Framework

### Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA)
Most states have adopted RUFADAA, which provides:

**Access Hierarchy (in order of priority):**
1. **Online tool** (e.g., Google Inactive Account Manager, Facebook Legacy Contact)
2. **Specific direction in will, trust, or POA**
3. **Terms of service agreement** (often very restrictive)

**Key Points:**
- Default is fiduciary can access "catalogue" (list of communications) but NOT content
- Must specifically authorize access to content
- Different rules for disclosure vs. termination

### States Without RUFADAA
A few states have alternative or no legislation - check specific state.

## Cryptocurrency Special Considerations

### Unique Challenges
- **Private keys**: If lost, assets are unrecoverable
- **No recovery mechanism**: Unlike banks, no reset option
- **Security vs. accessibility tradeoff**
- **Volatility**: Values can change dramatically

### Planning Approaches

**Seed Phrase Storage:**
- Document seed phrase/recovery words
- Store in multiple secure locations
- Consider splitting between locations (Shamir's Secret Sharing)
- Never store digitally (risk of hacking)

**Hardware Wallet:**
- Device PIN must be documented
- Explain how to access
- Store device safely

**Exchange Accounts:**
- Document exchange accounts and access
- Consider beneficiary designations if available (Coinbase, etc.)
- May have separate KYC verification issues

### Tax Considerations
- Cost basis documentation critical
- Different tax lots
- Gains/losses tracking
- **2026 Reporting:** Starting 2026, cryptocurrency brokers must report to IRS (1099-DA)

## Social Media Planning

### Platform-Specific Options

**Facebook:**
- Legacy Contact can memorialize or delete account
- Option to download data

**Google:**
- Inactive Account Manager
- Designate up to 10 trusted contacts
- Set inactivity timeout (3-18 months)
- Choose data sharing or deletion

**Apple:**
- Legacy Contact feature (iOS 15.2+)
- Designate people who can access data after death

**Twitter/X:**
- No legacy contact
- Account can be deactivated by family with death certificate

**LinkedIn:**
- Memorialize or remove profile
- Family must request with documentation

## Document Planning

### Include in Estate Plan

**Inventory of Digital Assets:**
- List all accounts
- Purpose and approximate value
- Access information (see security below)

**Grant Authority in Documents:**
Include specific digital asset language in:
- **Power of Attorney**: Access during incapacity
- **Will or Trust**: Access after death
- **HIPAA Authorization**: For health-related accounts

**Sample POA Language:**
> I grant my Agent full power and authority to access, manage, and control all my digital assets, including but not limited to email accounts, social media accounts, cryptocurrency, domain names, and any other digital property. This authority includes accessing the content of electronic communications to the extent permitted by law.

### Password Management

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Use password manager (LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden)
2. Document master password securely
3. Store instructions for accessing manager
4. Update regularly

**Storage Options:**
- Sealed envelope with attorney
- Safe deposit box
- Home safe
- Letter to fiduciary (secured)

**Avoid:**
- Listing passwords in will (becomes public record)
- Storing passwords unsecured
- Single point of failure

## Terms of Service Conflicts

Many platforms' Terms of Service:
- Prohibit sharing login credentials
- Limit transferability of accounts
- May allow termination on death
- Can override estate plan

**RUFADAA helps but doesn't solve all issues.**

## Fiduciary Duties

### What Fiduciaries Should Do
1. Secure digital assets immediately
2. Inventory all accounts
3. Preserve valuable content
4. Cancel recurring payments/subscriptions
5. Maintain security (update passwords if compromised)
6. Determine disposition per estate plan

### What Fiduciaries Should NOT Do
1. Access without authorization
2. Delete content without direction
3. Share login credentials broadly
4. Ignore account security

## Common Mistakes

1. **No digital asset inventory** - Fiduciary doesn't know what exists
2. **Passwords in will** - Will becomes public record
3. **No POA digital language** - Agent can't access during incapacity
4. **Relying on Terms of Service** - Usually restrictive
5. **No crypto planning** - Assets could be lost forever
6. **Outdated inventory** - New accounts not listed
7. **Single point of failure** - Only one person knows access
