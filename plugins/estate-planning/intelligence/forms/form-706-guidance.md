## Portability Election

### What is Portability?

Portability allows a surviving spouse to use the deceased spouse's unused estate tax exemption (DSUE).

### Requirements

1. Deceased spouse died after December 31, 2010
2. Deceased spouse was a US citizen or resident
3. Surviving spouse is a US citizen or resident
4. Complete and timely Form 706 filed (including extensions)
5. Election made on Form 706 (by not opting out)

### Benefits

- Doubles available exemption for married couples
- Second-to-die doesn't need complex trust structure
- Flexibility if exemption law changes

### Limitations

- Only transfers between spouses (remarriage overrides previous DSUE)
- Does not capture appreciation (unlike bypass trust)
- GST exemption is NOT portable
- Surviving spouse's DSUE is not indexed for inflation

### When to File Form 706 for Portability Only

Even if no estate tax is due, file Form 706 to preserve DSUE:
- Gross estate exceeds basic exclusion amount for purposes of valuing assets
- Or use simplified filing under Rev. Proc. 2017-34

**Late Portability Election:**
- IRS grants relief in some cases (2+ years after death)
- Must meet specific requirements
- File with PLR or use Rev. Proc. 2022-32 for estates under 2x exemption

---

## Valuation Date Elections

### Date of Death Valuation

- Default valuation date
- All assets valued as of date of death
- Required for portability election

### Alternate Valuation Date (Section 2032)

- Assets valued 6 months after death
- Available only if:
  - Reduces gross estate value AND
  - Reduces estate tax liability

**Caution:**
- Irrevocable election
- Affects basis for income tax purposes
- Cannot cherry-pick which assets to value on alternate date

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing portability election deadline** - File on time even if no tax due
2. **Incorrect valuations** - Get appraisals for real estate, businesses, collectibles
3. **Missing assets** - Life insurance, retirement accounts, digital assets
4. **Forgetting 3-year rule assets** - Transferred life insurance policies
5. **Incorrect QTIP election** - Must be specific about which property qualifies
6. **Missing state estate tax return** - Some states have separate returns
7. **Underpaying estimated tax** - Tax is due at 9 months even if filing extended
8. **Poor record keeping** - Document all valuations and decisions
