## Special Situations

### Married Owners

If property is owned as tenants by the entirety or joint tenants with right of survivorship:
- Both spouses should sign the TOD deed
- Consider whether TOD is needed if survivorship already applies

### Multiple Beneficiaries

Specify exactly how beneficiaries should take title:
- "as tenants in common" (default - each owns separate share)
- "as joint tenants with right of survivorship"
- "per stirpes" (descendants take share of deceased beneficiary)

### Beneficiary Predeceases Owner

Options:
1. Name contingent beneficiary
2. Specify "per stirpes" (descendants inherit)
3. If no contingent and no per stirpes: property passes through estate

---

## Limitations and Warnings

### TOD Deed Does NOT:
- Provide incapacity protection (unlike trust)
- Protect from owner's creditors during lifetime
- Protect beneficiary from their own creditors after death
- Avoid liens or encumbrances on the property
- Supersede a valid contract to convey

### Potential Issues:
- Beneficiary may owe capital gains if property sold (stepped-up basis applies)
- Medicaid/TennCare may have recovery rights against property
- May create title issues if improperly executed
- Does not affect mortgage - beneficiary takes subject to existing debt
