Load during beneficiary review phase.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Beneficiary Designation** | Form filed with financial institution or insurance company naming who receives account/policy at death. Overrides will and trust! |
| **Primary Beneficiary** | First person to receive benefits. Gets everything if living at account owner's death. |
| **Contingent Beneficiary** | Backup beneficiary who receives benefits only if primary beneficiary predeceases or disclaims. |
| **POD (Payable on Death)** | Beneficiary designation for bank accounts. Account passes directly to named beneficiary, avoiding probate. |
| **TOD (Transfer on Death)** | Beneficiary designation for brokerage accounts and securities. Same concept as POD. |
| **Per Stirpes** | Distribution method where deceased beneficiary's share passes down to their children. If your child dies before you, their share goes to your grandchildren. |
| **Per Capita** | Distribution method where shares are divided equally among living beneficiaries at each generation. Deceased beneficiary's share doesn't pass to their children. |
| **Per Capita at Each Generation** | Hybrid method where living members of each generation share equally. Most common modern approach. |
| **Disclaim** | Legally refuse an inheritance. Disclaimed assets pass as if disclaiming person died first. Can be useful for tax planning. |
| **IRA Beneficiary** | Person inheriting an IRA. Required minimum distributions apply, with rules varying by beneficiary type. |
| **Stretch IRA** | Strategy of stretching IRA distributions over beneficiary's lifetime. SECURE Act limited this for most non-spouse beneficiaries to 10-year payout. |
| **Designated Beneficiary** | Named individual on retirement account. Gets better tax treatment than estate or non-person beneficiary. |
| **See-Through Trust** | Trust meeting IRS requirements to be treated as designated beneficiary for retirement accounts. Allows stretch treatment (where still available). |
