| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Special Needs Trust (SNT)** | Trust designed to provide for disabled beneficiary without disqualifying them from government benefits like SSI and Medicaid. |
| **Third-Party SNT** | Special needs trust funded by parents, grandparents, or others (not the beneficiary). No Medicaid payback required at beneficiary's death. |
| **First-Party SNT** | Special needs trust funded with beneficiary's own assets (personal injury settlement, inheritance received outright). Requires Medicaid payback at death. |
| **Pooled Trust** | Special needs trust managed by nonprofit organization, pooling funds from multiple beneficiaries. Often more economical for smaller amounts. |
| **Supplemental Needs** | Expenses beyond what government benefits cover - recreation, education, travel, personal items, specialized equipment. What SNT should pay for. |
| **Medicaid Payback** | Requirement that first-party SNT reimburse Medicaid for benefits paid during beneficiary's lifetime. Comes from trust assets at beneficiary's death. |
| **ABLE Account** | Achieving a Better Life Experience account. Tax-advantaged savings for disability expenses. Up to $100,000 doesn't affect SSI. Age limit expands to 46 in 2026. |
| **SSI** | Supplemental Security Income. Federal benefit for aged, blind, or disabled with limited income and resources. Asset limits make SNT planning crucial. |
| **Medicaid** | Federal-state health coverage program with strict asset limits. SNT preserves eligibility while providing supplemental support. |
| **Resource Limit** | Maximum assets beneficiary can own and remain eligible for SSI/Medicaid. Generally $2,000 for SSI (not counting home, car, etc.). |
| **Letter of Intent (SNT)** | Detailed document describing beneficiary's needs, preferences, routines, medical information, and relationships for future caregivers. Not legally binding but invaluable. |
| **Remainder Beneficiary** | Person or organization receiving SNT assets after disabled beneficiary's death (after any Medicaid payback). |
| **Trust Protector (SNT)** | Especially important for SNT - can adapt trust to changing laws and benefit programs over beneficiary's lifetime. |
| **Sole Benefit Rule** | Requirement that SNT distributions benefit ONLY the disabled beneficiary, not family members or others. |
