| **Common Law Property** | Property system in most states where property belongs to whoever earned it or whose name is on the title. |
| **Step-Up in Basis** | Tax benefit where inherited assets receive a new cost basis equal to fair market value at death. Eliminates capital gains on appreciation during decedent's lifetime. |

| **Fair Market Value (FMV)** | Price an asset would sell for in an open market transaction between willing buyer and willing seller. |
| **Joint Tenancy** | Ownership by two or more people with right of survivorship. At death, property passes automatically to surviving owners, not through probate. |
| **Tenancy by the Entirety** | Special joint ownership available only to married couples in some states. Provides creditor protection. |
| **Tenancy in Common** | Ownership by two or more people without right of survivorship. Each owner's share passes through their estate at death. |
| **Right of Survivorship** | Automatic transfer of ownership to surviving co-owners at death. Avoids probate but may have unintended consequences. |
