# Pour-Over Will - Template Structure

## Document Overview

A pour-over will works in conjunction with a revocable living trust. It ensures any assets not titled in the trust at death are "poured over" into the trust for distribution according to the trust terms.

## Template Purpose

This template provides the structural framework for generating educational pour-over will documents. The agent will adapt sections based on:
- State execution requirements
- Family situation
- Guardian designations
- Trust integration

> I give the following items:
> - [Item] to [Beneficiary]
> - [Item] to [Beneficiary]

---

## Article IV: Residuary Estate (Pour-Over Clause)

### Pour-Over Language

**Standard Pour-Over Clause**:

> I give all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, both real and personal, wherever located (my "residuary estate"), to the Trustee then serving under the [GRANTOR NAME] REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST dated [TRUST DATE], as amended, to be held, administered, and distributed according to the terms of said trust.
>
> If for any reason the pour-over to said trust fails or is not legally effective, I direct that my residuary estate be distributed as if I had died on the date of my death and as if the residuary estate were the trust estate, following the terms of the trust in effect on my death.

### Integration Requirements
- Trust must exist at time of will execution (or simultaneous)
- Trust must be identified with certainty
- Will references trust "as amended" to capture changes

---

## Article V: Guardian Designation

### For Minor Children

**Primary Guardian**:
> If my [spouse/partner] does not survive me, I nominate [GUARDIAN NAME] of [City, State] as guardian of the person of my minor children.

**Alternate Guardian**:
> If [PRIMARY GUARDIAN] is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate [ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME] as successor guardian.

### Guardian's Powers
> The guardian shall have authority to determine residence, education, healthcare, and general welfare of my children.

### Property Guardian (if not using trust)
> I nominate [NAME] as guardian of my minor children's property.

**Note**: If trust is properly funded, property guardianship often unnecessary.

### Special Considerations
- Both parents must consent or be deceased
- Court makes final determination
- Statement of reasoning can be helpful
- Consider child's age and relationship with guardian

---

## Article VII: Trust for Minors (Backup)

### Backup Minor's Trust

If trust fails, will should contain backup provisions:

### Purpose
- Prevents property passing to dying beneficiary's estate
- Simplifies administration
- Avoids double probate

---

## Article IX: Simultaneous Death

### Simultaneous Death Clause

> If my spouse and I die under circumstances making it difficult or impossible to determine who died first, my spouse shall be deemed to have survived me for purposes of this Will.
>
> However, for any property for which my spouse is required to survive me (such as insurance or joint accounts), I shall be deemed to have survived my spouse.
