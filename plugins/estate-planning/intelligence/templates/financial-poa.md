# Durable Financial Power of Attorney - Template Structure

## Document Overview

A Durable Power of Attorney (POA) for finances allows a trusted person (agent or attorney-in-fact) to manage your financial affairs if you become incapacitated. "Durable" means it remains effective during incapacity.

## Template Purpose

This template provides the structural framework for generating educational financial POA documents. The agent will adapt sections based on:
- State statutory requirements
- Scope of powers needed
- Springing vs. immediate effectiveness
- Special circumstances
