## Template: A-B Trust Provisions for Revocable Trust

These provisions can be added to a revocable living trust to create an
A-B trust structure at the first death:

```
ARTICLE [X]: DIVISION UPON FIRST DEATH

Upon the death of the first Grantor to die ("Deceased Grantor"), the Trust
shall be divided into the following sub-trusts:

## [X].1 Survivor's Trust ("A Trust")

The surviving Grantor's share of the Trust Estate shall be allocated to a
separate trust known as the "Survivor's Trust" or "A Trust." This trust shall
remain revocable by the surviving Grantor and shall be administered as follows:

   (a) The surviving Grantor shall be the sole Trustee and beneficiary during
       their lifetime.
   (b) The surviving Grantor may amend, revoke, or modify this trust at any
       time.
   (c) Upon the surviving Grantor's death, this trust shall be distributed per
       Article [distribution article].

## [X].2 Bypass Trust ("B Trust" or "Credit Shelter Trust")

The Deceased Grantor's share of the Trust Estate, up to the applicable
federal estate tax exemption amount, shall be allocated to a separate
irrevocable trust known as the "Bypass Trust," "B Trust," or "Credit Shelter
Trust." This trust shall be administered as follows:

   (a) Income: The Trustee SHALL distribute all net income to the surviving
       Grantor at least quarterly.

   (b) Principal: The Trustee MAY distribute principal to the surviving
       Grantor as necessary for their health, education, maintenance, and
       support, considering other resources available.

   (c) Limited Withdrawal Right: The surviving Grantor may withdraw up to 5%
       of the Trust principal annually (5 and 5 power), or $5,000, whichever
       is greater.

   (d) Upon the surviving Grantor's death, the remaining Bypass Trust assets
       shall be distributed per Article [distribution article].

## [X].3 Marital Trust (Optional QTIP)

[IF estate exceeds exemption OR if blended family]

Any portion of the Deceased Grantor's share exceeding the exemption amount
may be allocated to a Marital Trust (QTIP) at the election of the Trustee
(in consultation with the surviving Grantor and tax counsel).

The Marital Trust shall be administered as follows:

   (a) The Trustee SHALL distribute all net income to the surviving Grantor
       at least quarterly.

   (b) Principal: The Trustee MAY distribute principal to the surviving
       Grantor as necessary for their health, education, maintenance, and
       support.

   (c) The surviving Grantor shall have the right to direct the Trustee to
       make the property productive of income or convert non-productive
       property to productive property.

   (d) Upon the surviving Grantor's death, the remaining Marital Trust assets
       shall be distributed per Article [distribution article].

[[ ATTORNEY REVIEW: QTIP election must be made on Form 706. Executor should
consult tax counsel regarding optimal allocation between Bypass and Marital
Trusts. ]]

## [X].4 Formula Clause

The amount allocated to the Bypass Trust shall be the maximum amount that
can pass free of federal estate tax, taking into account:
   (a) The applicable exemption amount in effect at the Deceased Grantor's death;
   (b) Adjusted taxable gifts made during the Deceased Grantor's lifetime;
   (c) Other assets passing outside this Trust that use exemption.

[[ ATTORNEY REVIEW: Formula clauses require careful drafting. Consult tax
counsel to ensure clause produces intended result under current and future
law. ]]

## Generator Notes

When generating irrevocable trust language:

1. **Always include warnings** - Irrevocability has permanent consequences
2. **Specify trustee cannot be grantor** - For ILIT, this is critical
3. **Include Crummey provisions** - For gift tax annual exclusion
4. **Note 3-year rule** - For transferred (not new) policies
5. **Reference attorney review** - Irrevocable trusts require professional counsel
