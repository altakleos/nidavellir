## Key Differences from Common Law POA

| Common Law (49 States) | Louisiana Civil Law |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Power of Attorney | Mandate / Procuration |
| Agent / Attorney-in-Fact | Mandatary |
| Principal | Principal (same) |
| Durable (by default in many states) | Must include durability language |
| Special powers recommended | Special mandate REQUIRED for certain acts |
| Notarization recommended | Notarization + 2 witnesses required |

---

## Generator Notes

When generating Louisiana mandates:

1. **Use civil law terminology** - Mandate, Mandatary (not POA, Agent)
2. **Include durability clause** - Louisiana mandates are not automatically durable
3. **Require explicit special powers** - Cannot perform certain acts without express authorization
4. **Require notarization + 2 witnesses** - For valid execution
5. **Separate healthcare mandate option** - May be combined or separate document
