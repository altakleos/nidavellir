# Beneficiary Designation Coordination Checklist

## Overview

This checklist helps coordinate retirement account and life insurance beneficiary designations with your overall estate plan. For retirement-heavy estates, **beneficiary designations often control more wealth than your trust or will**.

**Important**: Beneficiary designations override your will and trust. Assets pass directly to named beneficiaries regardless of what your trust says.

## SECURE Act 2.0 Key Rules (Effective 2020+)

### The 10-Year Rule

Most non-spouse beneficiaries must withdraw inherited retirement accounts within **10 years** of the account owner's death.

**Exceptions (Eligible Designated Beneficiaries who can still stretch):**
- Surviving spouse
- Minor children of the account owner (until age of majority, then 10-year rule)
- Disabled individuals (as defined by IRS)
- Chronically ill individuals
- Individuals not more than 10 years younger than the deceased

**Planning Impact:**
- Large IRAs inherited by adult children will face compressed distribution timeline
- Consider Roth conversions to reduce future tax burden on heirs
- Trust as beneficiary adds complexity (see below)

## Common Beneficiary Designation Options

### Option 1: Name Spouse as Primary (Most Common)

**Best for:** Married couples who want spouse to have full access

```
Primary: [Spouse Name], 100%
Contingent: [Children], equally per stirpes
```

**Advantages:**
- Spouse can roll over to their own IRA
- Spouse can delay RMDs until their own RMD age
- Spouse can name new beneficiaries

**Disadvantages:**
- No creditor protection for spouse
- If spouse remarries, assets could go to new spouse's family

### Option 2: Name Trust as Beneficiary

**Best for:** When control after death is priority (minor children, special needs, creditor concerns)

```
Primary: [Trust Name], dated [Date], 100%
Contingent: [Backup Trust or Individuals]
```

**Requirements for "See-Through" Trust Status:**
- [ ] Trust is valid under state law
- [ ] Trust is irrevocable at owner's death (or becomes irrevocable)
- [ ] Beneficiaries are identifiable from trust document
- [ ] Trust copy provided to plan administrator by October 31 of year after death

**Warning:** If trust doesn't qualify as "see-through," entire account may need to be distributed within 5 years.

### Option 3: Name Individuals Directly

**Best for:** Simple situations with responsible adult beneficiaries

```
Primary: [Child 1], 50%; [Child 2], 50%
Contingent: Descendants of each child, per stirpes
```

**Advantages:**
- Simplest administration
- Each beneficiary has own 10-year window

**Disadvantages:**
- No spendthrift protection
- No control over distributions
- Minor children can't inherit directly (need custodian)

### Option 4: Special Needs Trust as Beneficiary

**Best for:** When beneficiary receives government benefits

```
Primary: [SNT Name] for [Beneficiary Name], 100%
OR
Primary: [Spouse] 50%, [SNT Name] for [Beneficiary] 50%
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- Must qualify as see-through trust
- Must be drafted to preserve government benefits
- Consider whether beneficiary is "disabled" for SECURE Act exception

## Coordination with Trust Planning

### When Trust Says One Thing, Beneficiary Form Says Another

**The beneficiary form WINS.**

Example: Trust says "divide equally among children." But IRA beneficiary form names only oldest child. → Oldest child gets entire IRA.

### Checklist: Alignment Verification

- [ ] Trust beneficiaries match intended IRA beneficiaries
- [ ] Per stirpes provisions consistent across all documents
- [ ] Minor children provisions aligned (trust for minors vs. UGMA)
- [ ] Special needs beneficiary addressed consistently
- [ ] Disinherited individuals excluded from ALL designations

---

## Blended Family Considerations

### Protecting Children from Prior Marriage

**Challenge:** If spouse is sole beneficiary, children from prior marriage may receive nothing.

**Options:**

1. **Split beneficiary designation:**
   ```
   Primary: [Spouse] 50%, [Children from Prior Marriage] 50%
   ```

2. **Trust as beneficiary with QTIP provisions:**
   - Spouse gets income for life
   - Remainder to children from prior marriage

3. **Designate children directly:**
   - Bypasses spouse entirely
   - Consider if this matches overall plan

### Verify Consistency

- [ ] Stepchildren included/excluded consistently
- [ ] Children from prior marriage protected if intended
- [ ] Spouse's access aligns with trust provisions

---

## Special Situations

### Minor Children as Beneficiaries

**Problem:** Minors cannot directly inherit retirement accounts.

**Solutions:**
- Name a custodian under UTMA/UGMA
- Name trust for minor's benefit
- Name guardian of the estate

**SECURE Act Note:** Minor children of the account owner are "eligible designated beneficiaries" until they reach age of majority, then 10-year rule applies.

### Disabled or Chronically Ill Beneficiaries

**Advantages:**
- Eligible designated beneficiary status = can stretch distributions
- May qualify for exception to 10-year rule

**Documentation Required:**
- [ ] Physician certification of disability
- [ ] Documentation meeting IRS requirements

### Charity as Beneficiary

**Tax Advantage:** Charity receives retirement funds income-tax-free.

**Options:**
- Name charity for specific percentage
- Name charity as contingent beneficiary
- Charitable Remainder Trust as beneficiary
