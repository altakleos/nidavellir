- Not reported on gift tax return (below exclusion)
- Does not reduce lifetime exemption

### Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption

- Taxable gifts reduce available estate exemption
- Gift tax paid at same 40% rate

## Estate Tax

### What's Included in Gross Estate
- All property owned at death
- Life insurance on decedent's life (if owned or incidents of ownership)
- Revocable trust assets
- Joint property (full value with non-spouse, 50% with spouse)
- Retirement accounts
- Gifts within 3 years (for certain purposes)
- Powers of appointment

### Deductions from Gross Estate
- **Marital deduction**: Unlimited transfers to surviving spouse
- **Charitable deduction**: Unlimited to qualified charities
- **Debts and expenses**: Mortgages, administration costs
- **State death taxes**: Deductible for federal

### Calculating Estate Tax

```
Gross Estate
- Deductions (marital, charitable, debts, expenses)
= Taxable Estate
+ Adjusted Taxable Gifts (lifetime gifts over annual exclusion)
= Tax Base
× Tax Rate (graduated up to 40%)
= Tentative Tax
- Unified Credit (equivalent to BEA)
- Other Credits
= Estate Tax Due
```

## Portability

### What is Portability?
Surviving spouse can use deceased spouse's unused exclusion (DSUE).

**Requirements:**
- Must be married at death
- Executor must file Form 706 (even if no tax due)
- Must elect portability on timely filed return
- Only applies to last deceased spouse

### Portability vs. Credit Shelter Trust

| Factor | Portability | Credit Shelter Trust |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Simplicity | Simpler | More complex |
| Asset protection | None | Some protection possible |
| State estate tax | May not help | May preserve state exemption |
| Growth | Growth in survivor's estate | Growth outside survivor's estate |
| Remarriage | Lost if survivor remarries | Protected |
| Basis step-up | At first death | Only at first death |

**Best practice:** Consider filing Form 706 for portability even if also using trust planning.

## Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax

### What is GST Tax?
Additional 40% tax on transfers to "skip persons" (generally grandchildren or lower).

### GST Exemption
- **Same as estate exemption**: $13.99M (2025)
- Allocated differently than estate exemption
- NOT portable (unlike estate exemption)

### Types of GST Transfers
- **Direct skip**: Gift directly to grandchild
- **Taxable termination**: Trust ends, passes to skip person
- **Taxable distribution**: Distribution from trust to skip person

### GST Planning
- Allocate GST exemption to trusts for descendants
- "GST-exempt trust" = no GST tax on future distributions
- Dynasty trusts leverage GST exemption for multiple generations

## Key Filing Requirements

### Form 706 (Estate Tax Return)
**Required when:**
- Gross estate + adjusted taxable gifts > $13.99M (2025)
- Portability election desired (regardless of estate size)

**Due:** 9 months after death (6-month extension available)

### Form 709 (Gift Tax Return)
**Required when:**
- Gifts exceed annual exclusion
- Gift-splitting
- Gifts to 529 exceeding 5x annual exclusion
- Gifts of future interests

**Due:** April 15 following year of gift (extension available)

## State Death Tax Credit vs. Deduction

**Historical:** Prior to 2005, federal credit for state death taxes effectively made state taxes "free."

**Current:** Only a **deduction** (not credit) for state death taxes. States with death taxes now represent additional cost.

## Common Planning Strategies

### Lifetime Gifting
- Use annual exclusion systematically
- Consider larger gifts using lifetime exemption
- Pay tuition/medical directly (unlimited)
- Gift appreciating assets (freeze value)

### Trust Planning
- Credit shelter trusts (A-B trusts)
- QTIP trusts for blended families
- Irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILIT)
- Grantor retained annuity trusts (GRAT)
- Charitable trusts (CRT, CLT)

### Charitable Planning
- Outright bequests (unlimited deduction)
- Charitable remainder trusts
- Charitable lead trusts
- Donor advised funds
- Private foundations
