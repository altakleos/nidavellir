# State Death Taxes Summary

## Overview

As of 2025, the following states and DC impose death taxes. States are divided into:

- **Inheritance Tax States**: Tax on the beneficiary based on relationship
- **Both**: A few states have both types

## Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Detail

Pennsylvania has unique inheritance tax (not estate tax):

| Beneficiary | Tax Rate |
|-------------|----------|
| Surviving spouse | **0%** |
| Lineal descendants (children, grandchildren) | **4.5%** |
| Siblings | **12%** |
| All others (nieces, nephews, friends) | **15%** |

**Key Features:**
- Tax on **first dollar** (no exemption threshold)
- Due within 9 months
- **5% discount if paid within 3 months**
- Trusts do NOT avoid PA inheritance tax

## New York Estate Tax CLIFF

**CRITICAL**: New York has a unique "cliff" that can devastate estates:

| Estate Value | Result |
|--------------|--------|
| ≤ $7,160,000 | No NY estate tax |
| $7,160,001 - $7,518,000 | Tax only on excess |
| ≥ $7,518,001 (105% of exemption) | **ENTIRE estate taxed** |

**Example Impact:**
- Estate of $7.5M → ~$200,000 tax
- Estate of $7.6M → ~$600,000 tax
- $100,000 more assets = $400,000 more tax

**Planning:** Use charitable bequests, life insurance trusts, or other techniques to stay below cliff.

## States with NO Death Tax

The majority of states (33 + territories) have no estate or inheritance tax:

Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana*, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

*Indiana's inheritance tax was repealed (phased out by 2022).

## Portability of State Exemption

**No State Has Portability** (unlike federal)

This means:
- Credit shelter trusts still relevant for state tax planning
- Each spouse must use their own state exemption
- Federal portability doesn't help with state taxes

## Planning Implications by Threshold

### Estates $1M - $2M
- **Oregon** and **Massachusetts** planning triggered
- Consider credit shelter trust
- Life insurance outside estate

### Estates $2M - $5M
- **Washington**, **Minnesota**, **Illinois** affected
- State-only credit shelter trust may be useful
- Review annually as values change

### Estates $5M - $7M
- **NY cliff planning critical**
- **Hawaii**, **Maine**, **Vermont** affected
- Charitable planning may reduce below thresholds

### Estates $7M+
- Most state taxes apply
- Coordinate federal and state planning
- Consider state of domicile

## Domicile Planning

For high-net-worth individuals, state of residence matters:

**Tax-Friendly States (no income or death taxes):**
- Florida
- Nevada
- South Dakota
- Texas
- Wyoming

**Changing Domicile Considerations:**
- Physical presence
- Voter registration
- Driver's license
- Professional registrations
- Bank accounts
- Where you spend time
- Intent (declaration of domicile)

**Warning:** States may challenge domicile changes, especially near death.

## Reciprocity and Credits

### Inheritance Tax Reciprocity
Some inheritance tax states exempt beneficiaries who are residents of states without inheritance tax.

### Credits for Taxes Paid
- Maryland: Credit for inheritance tax against estate tax
- States may credit taxes paid to other states on property located there

## Annual Updates

State death tax thresholds change annually. Many are indexed for inflation.

**Always verify current year thresholds before planning.**
