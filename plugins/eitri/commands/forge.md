# Forge Command

This command launches Eitri - your intelligent skill creation assistant.

## What Happens

When you type `/forge`, I'll start a conversation to understand your unique needs and create the perfect skill(s) for you.

## The Process

1. **Context Discovery** - I'll ask about your business, team, and needs
2. **Architecture Design** - I'll suggest the optimal skill structure
3. **Configuration** - We'll fine-tune the details together
4. **Creation** - I'll generate everything you need
5. **Delivery** - You'll receive complete, ready-to-use skill(s)

## How to Invoke

Simply type:
```
/forge
```

Then engage in a natural conversation. I'll guide you through everything.

## What Makes This Special

I don't use rigid templates. Instead, I:
- Understand your unique context deeply
- Synthesize patterns from multiple dimensions
- Create something genuinely tailored for you
- Adapt based on our conversation

## Example Interaction

```
You: /forge

Me: Tell me about what you're trying to accomplish - not just the task, but the context around it. What's your business or work environment like?

You: I run a small e-commerce business and spend hours every week manually updating inventory across multiple platforms.

Me: I understand the pain of manual inventory management. Let me learn more about your specific situation. How many products are we talking about, and which platforms do you use?

[Conversation continues naturally...]
```
